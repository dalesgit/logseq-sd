<a name=1></a>101 Characteristics of<br/>Americans/American Culture&#160;<br/>
To help you compare and contrast what you observe of American<br/>culture and your own, mark the similarities and differences between<br/>your culture and what you have read about in this book.&#160;<br/>
1.&#160;America is enormous: the third largest country in the world<br/>
with a population of more than 300 million people.<br/>
2.&#160;Americans come in all colors, have all types of religions, and<br/>
speak many languages from all over the world.&#160;<br/>
3.&#160;Americans are extremely independent, individualistic, and like<br/>
to be different from each other.&#160;<br/>
4.&#160;66% of Americans are overweight; 37% of those are obese.&#160;<br/>
5.&#160;Americans believe&#160;in freedom of choice.<br/>
6.&#160;Americans need a lot of “elbow room”; they like personal<br/>
space around them.&#160;<br/>
7.&#160;Approximately 1% of Americans are homeless (3.5 million<br/>
people).&#160;<br/>
8.&#160;Americans talk easily to the homeless but use good judgment<br/>
and are careful with whom they talk.&#160;<br/>
9.&#160;Sadly,&#160;the streets of major cities are often dirty.&#160;<br/>
10.&#160;Many people, especially teenagers, wear strange clothes, and<br/>
many have tattoos and body piercings.&#160;<br/>
11.&#160;Americans follow the rule of law.<br/>
1<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=2></a>12.&#160;Littering (throwing garbage on the street), graffiti and tagging<br/>
(writing on the walls), and loitering (standing around and<br/>doing nothing) are against the law and are punishable by a<br/>fine or jail.<br/>
13.&#160;Discriminating against or making any insulting statement<br/>
about someone else’s religion or ethnicity is against the law<br/>and could be punishable as a&#160;<i>hate crime.</i><br/>
14.&#160;You must be over the age of 21 and you must have an<br/>
identification card with a photo to buy or drink alcohol.&#160;<br/>
15.&#160;In most states, it is illegal to buy cigarettes if you are under the<br/>
age of 18 and often you can only smoke in certain places.&#160;<br/>
16.&#160;<i>A</i>mericans are extremely informal and call most people by<br/>
their first name or nickname.&#160;<br/>
17.&#160;Americans smile a lot and talk easily to strangers, sharing<br/>
personal stories.<br/>
18.&#160;Asking “How are you?” is simply a greeting and is not a<br/>
question about your health.&#160;<br/>
19.&#160;When Americans put their hands on their hips, they are<br/>
usually relaxed; when they fold their arms tightly across their<br/>chests, they are angry or very serious (or cold).&#160;<br/>
20.&#160;Americans don’t push or stand too close to anyone in line.<br/>
They always wait their turn.&#160;<br/>
21.&#160;In a restaurant, the server is usually very friendly and helpful<br/>
and often will tell you his or her name.<br/>
22.&#160;When the service is good, tipping is expected to be 15–20% of<br/>
the bill.&#160;<br/>
2<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=3></a>23.&#160;Polite Americans eat with one hand while the other one is<br/>
under the table on their laps.&#160;<br/>
24.&#160;Usually, when friends meet at a restaurant they each pay their<br/>
share of the bill or split the bill in half. It’s called&#160;<i>going Dutch.</i><br/>
25.&#160;If you have guests over to your house, turn off the television,<br/>
make sure your music isn’t too loud.&#160;<br/>
26.&#160;Americans have parties for many reasons. Sometimes they are<br/>
held for friends to get together and to meet new people. There<br/>is rarely music or dancing at a typical American party.&#160;<br/>
27.&#160;When you meet Americans, be sure to look them in the eye,<br/>
smile, and shake hands.<br/>
28.&#160;Make small talk at the beginning of a conversation. After a few<br/>
questions, you will be asked, “What do you do?” (This means<br/>what is your job?)<br/>
29.&#160;For weddings and showers, people register for gifts at a specific<br/>
place.&#160;<br/>
30.&#160;Americans open presents and cards in front of people.<br/>
31.&#160;Be sure you include a card with your gift. The person given the<br/>
gift will send you a thank you card.<br/>
32.&#160;At an American funeral, it is not normal to make loud sad<br/>
sounds. Americans try to keep strong emotions inside.&#160;<br/>
33.&#160;There is no traditional color or flower that symbolizes death.<br/>
Any and all flowers can be used at funerals.&#160;<br/>
34.&#160;We do not give money at a funeral. Sometimes, we send<br/>
flowers or plants to the ceremony.&#160;<br/>
35.&#160;After the funeral, there is usually a reception at the home of the<br/>
family. There is usually a lot of food and sometimes alcohol.&#160;<br/>
3<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=4></a>36.&#160;Never ask Americans a direct question about their religion,<br/>
age, money, salary, weight, or dress/suit size.&#160;<br/>
37.&#160;Do not make any racist or negative remarks about someone’s<br/>
religion, family background, or sexual preferences.&#160;<br/>
38.&#160;Men should not make any “sexist” remarks to or about<br/>
women—anything that would make women unequal to men.&#160;<br/>
39.&#160;Americans say that they don’t want to talk about politics, but<br/>
sometimes they do. It’s best to just listen first to see the other<br/>person’s point of view before you let them know your<br/>thoughts.&#160;<br/>
40.&#160;Never go to someone’s house without calling first to see if it is<br/>
convenient.<br/>
41.&#160;If you are invited to an American party, do not bring your<br/>
children, friends, or family members without first asking the<br/>permission of the host.<br/>
42<i>.&#160;</i>Time is money. Never be late to classes, employment interviews,<br/>
appointments, parties (especially your wedding!), etc.&#160;<br/>
43.&#160;Some Americans hug a lot. It is okay for women and men to<br/>
hug even if they are not close friends.&#160;<br/>
44.&#160;It is normal for American women to have&#160;male friends who<br/>
are just friends (and vice versa).<br/>
45.&#160;It is not uncommon for American men and women to share an<br/>
apartment as roommates and not have&#160;a&#160;sexual relationship<br/>with each other.&#160;<br/>
46.&#160;Most American women do not like possessive or jealous men.<br/>
47.&#160;Most American women do not feel comfortable having the<br/>
man pay for everything all of the time.<br/>
4<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=5></a>48.&#160;Be careful: Meet new friends in a public place many times<br/>
before you get into a car or give out your address.&#160;<br/>
49.&#160;American parents speak to their children as adults and teach<br/>
them how to be responsible for their actions.<br/>
50.&#160;American parents encourage their children to question and<br/>
always ask “Why?”&#160;<br/>
51.&#160;It is normal for American children to have very messy rooms.<br/>
52.&#160;It is common for young Americans to carry&#160;<i>security blankets&#160;</i>or<br/>
a&#160;stuffed toy.&#160;<br/>
53.&#160;Americans do not hit their children but discipline them by<br/>
taking things away.&#160;<br/>
54.&#160;American men try to share equally with their wives in<br/>
parenting and housework.<br/>
55.&#160;Americans hire “babysitters” to take care of their children<br/>
when they go out or are at work.&#160;<br/>
56.&#160;Americans love their pets, sometimes more than they love<br/>
people.<br/>
57.&#160;Homosexuality is protected by&#160;law in the United States.&#160;<br/>
58.&#160;The majority of older Americans prefer to live in&#160;<i>retirement</i><br/>
<i>homes&#160;</i>for independent living rather than to live with their<br/>grown children.<br/>
59.&#160;Americans admire youth and often work past age 65 and/or<br/>
go back to school.<br/>
60.&#160;Domestic violence is against the law. It is illegal to hit anyone:<br/>
a&#160;spouse, a parent, a child, and even a pet.&#160;<br/>
61.&#160;There are special seats in the front of buses reserved for<br/>
disabled people or senior citizens.&#160;<br/>
5<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=6></a>62.&#160;Be careful when you offer your seat on the bus to an older or a<br/>
disabled person. Most older people do not want to be thought<br/>of as someone needing help.<br/>
63.&#160;Most buses require the exact amount of money and cannot<br/>
make change.&#160;<br/>
64.&#160;Because of pick-pockets, Americans carry credit cards and<br/>
checks, instead of a lot of cash.&#160;<br/>
65.&#160;Pedestrians always have the right of way.&#160;<br/>
66.&#160;Pedestrians must cross at a cross walk or unmarked<br/>
intersection. Crossing in the middle of the road is against&#160;<br/>the law.<br/>
67.&#160;If it is not a life or death emergency, do not call 911.&#160;<br/>
68.&#160;Rent must be paid on time or there is usually a late fee.&#160;<br/>
69.&#160;If you pay your rent by cash, be sure to get a receipt.&#160;<br/>
70.&#160;Americans love to hunt for bargains and often buy used<br/>
things.&#160;<br/>
71.&#160;If the police put the lights on to tell you to stop your car,<br/>
move&#160;to the side of the road right away. Stay in your car.&#160;<br/>
72.&#160;Look directly at the officer. Smile and say, “What seems to be<br/>
the problem, Officer?”&#160;<br/>
73.&#160;When you drive, be sure to always have your license,<br/>
registration, and proof of insurance with you.&#160;<br/>
74.&#160;Never,&#160;for any reason, argue with or give money to a police<br/>
officer.&#160;<br/>
75.&#160;Always be on time to the job interview and to your job.<br/>
76.&#160;Dress appropriately for the job interview.<br/>
6<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=7></a>77.&#160;Smile, look the interviewer in the eye, and shake hands firmly<br/>
when you meet.&#160;<br/>
78.&#160;At the interview, be positive and describe your good qualities.&#160;<br/>
79.&#160;Sexual harassment is against the law.&#160;<br/>
80.&#160;<i>S</i>tudents are expected to ask questions.&#160;<br/>
81.&#160;Never use a cell phone in class.&#160;<br/>
82.&#160;It is normal for an American teacher to sit on the desk.&#160;<br/>
83.&#160;Always call your teacher by his or her name.&#160;<br/>
84.&#160;It is never too late to go back to school and you can almost<br/>
always find free adult education classes.&#160;<br/>
85.&#160;It is permitted to visit most college and university campuses to<br/>
see what they are like.&#160;<br/>
86.&#160;Children from the ages of 6 to 16 must attend school in the<br/>
United States.<br/>
87.&#160;Do your own work. Copying from a book, a friend, or the<br/>
Internet is called&#160;<i>plagiarism</i>.<br/>
88.&#160;Cheating is serious, and the punishment is strong.&#160;<br/>
89.&#160;Americans try to take care of a medical problem early.<br/>
90.&#160;When you have a serious medical problem, it’s a good idea to<br/>
get a second opinion.&#160;<br/>
91.&#160;You can always ask the receptionist how much a doctor’s<br/>
appointment will cost.&#160;<br/>
92.&#160;When you need to make an appointment with a doctor,&#160;list all<br/>
of your symptoms in English before you call.&#160;<br/>
93.&#160;Most states have&#160;free or low-cost clinics.<br/>
7<br/>
<hr/>
<a name=8></a>94.&#160;Never go to a hospital emergency room unless it is a matter of<br/>
life or death.&#160;<br/>
95.&#160;Americans are really careful about not bothering anyone else<br/>
with their body odor or bad breath.&#160;<br/>
96.&#160;Most Americans take at least one bath or shower each day.<br/>
97.&#160;Most Americans put on a good underarm deodorant after<br/>
bathing.&#160;<br/>
98.&#160;Throw all toilet paper and seat covers in the toilet to be<br/>
flushed away.<br/>
99.&#160;If you can’t understand the sign on the restroom door, ask<br/>
someone or check to see who goes in or comes out.&#160;<br/>
100.&#160;Americans often talk to each other or on the cell phone while<br/>
using the bathroom.&#160;<br/>
101.&#160;There are very few “public” bathrooms available in U.S. cities<br/>
and towns.<br/>
