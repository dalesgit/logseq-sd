		  10:48:52 From Carla McCook To Everyone:
		  	A resource we are using at St. Margaret of Scotland currently is the book "I Think You're Wrong, But I'm Listening," by Sarah Stewart Holland & Beth Silvers. It was published in 2019 -but it is helping three small groups here to listen deeply to one another, even when there are opposing viewpoints

		  	Great book!
		  	
		  10:50:14 From Tom Thoeni To Everyone:
		  	A lot of Church Law and Tax Report is behind a pay wall. I have found it is well worth having a subscription. It surprises me how often I consult it and what the subjects are that I research. For what it‚Äôs worth I have led two different parishes through a wholesale rewriting of bylaws and would be willing to talk with any of you to share my experiences and even failures.
