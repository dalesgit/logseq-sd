## Notes
	- Music: Carrie Newcomer "Sanctuary" -- Will you be my sanctuary until I can carryon.
	- Nina had a bad experience in CPE (long ago) feeling that they were invasive of sacred space. Apparently she experienced criticism.
	- LS: You all did well -- explore new avenues?

		- DH
			- Lots of body response entries
			- Made up story. Sounding fake? cf. final reflection
		- LS: Imagine SD as "empowerment" -- not ra-ra kine, but
		- Cherrie: a song with line "imagine what the water can't take away from you"

		- I got the SD / D reversed!
		- LS: she appreciates my affirming heart. say to him: "Thank you" "How are you doing with that now?"
			- LS: helping him unpack the prayer practice. "What happens within you? when you are praying?"
			- possible addressing the depression: What might God have been inviting you in the centering prayer darkness"
			- "SD is a place where it's safe to go down the darkness" "What happens within you when you are imagining scenes in your prayer."
			- How would it be different if this had been our 15th session.
			- Maybe the only reason for the session was to explain why he's not going on with Centering prayer.
		- Alison: Where was God in the darkness.
		- Esther: could you have probed the scripture texts?

			- Praying with
			- quoting scripture
			- she's also lacking in body responses
		- LS: like the simple prayer (from Alison?)
			- What would having a twinkle in the eye mean if you saw it.
			- It might be a time to use the cuinzane to unpack "What is love"
			- (SD6) what does it feel like to "feel unnoticed" **The temptation is to try to fix things.** but pull back and let the SDee discover it.
			- We can always offer silence and ask "What is God doing in this ..."
				- But maybe mirror back their words.
				- What is God telling you ...? (in dreams, scripture, experiences .... whatever)

			- take a deep breath, relax -- cf. class discussion and eg.
			- psalm 139
			- reflecting questions re. what's going on,
			- he is pretty directed, with content,
		- thoughts
			- DT:
				- she was the most normal weird person I know
				- He is used to having conversations with this friend. But at D7 he felt like he was being a spiritual director. **Connected**.
			- LS:
				- it is often problematic to start with a reading.
				- good to slow down, and be intentional entering the space
				- She doesn't want to be the one setting the agenda
				- she cautions about zoning in e.g. SD 5 (election etc.)
				- the key in D4 seems to be "**people are missing**"
				- Being present with others is getting connected to God (d-10)
			- AW: "tell me what moves you the most..." "What are some things you have seen ...
