	- "Second Coming"
	  collapsed:: true
		- Turning and turning in the widening gyre
		  The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
		  Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
		  Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
		  The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
		  The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
		  The best lack all conviction, while the worst
		  Are full of passionate intensity.
		-
		- Surely some revelation is at hand;
		  Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
		  The Second Coming! 
		  Hardly are those words out
		  When a vast image out ofÂ *Spiritus Mundi* [^1]
		  Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert
		  A shape with lion body and the head of a man,
		  A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
		  Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
		  Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.
		  The darkness drops again; but now I know
		  That twenty centuries of stony sleep
		  Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
		  And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
		  Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?
		  
		  [^1]: In Spiritus Mundi, there is, according to William Butler Yeats, ''**a universal memory and a muse of sorts that provides inspiration to the poet or writer**.'' To Yeats, Spiritus Mundi is the source of all ''images'' and ''symbols,'' a ''collective unconscious.''
