- Dear CAP Friends,
- I trust that you had a nice Thanksgiving.  We did and it was nice being with extended family.  Unfortunately we also received news that my husband has a rare cancer (sinonasal carcinoma) which will require a treatment journey :(  This is his second cancer go-round in 18 months.  Prayers appreciated!
- I just wanted to update you on **Module 2:  Building the SD Toolbox.
  logseq.order-list-type:: number
  *****Classes resume JAN 9 and end MAR 27.
- **T**he books required (to be read in this order)
- 1. Discernment by Rose Mary Dougherty
- 2. Faith Styles by John Mabry
- 3. In Touch by John Prendergast
- The first two are small books and can be read quite easily. It would be good to read Discernment by mid January since the first three classes are on that topic.  *You will have a 20 min video to watch and an experience form to fill out by Jan 9th on Ignatian discernment.* *  *I will send those separately after class Thursday!(no other articles for first class)
- I will provide a full syllabus by Christmas or shortly after.
- Please let me know if you need an invoice.  (I sent out a few of them to those who requested)
- See you Thursday.  Please be sure to send your verbatims Shea, Craig and Alison :)
