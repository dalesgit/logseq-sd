When some of the  [worst flash floods in decades](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/europe/spain-flash-floods.html)  in eastern Spain hit, Diego Hernandez was passing the city of Valencia on his way to his mother’s funeral.
As he and his wife drove on Tuesday night, a thin stream of muddy water started to appear under their tires. Soon, it was nearly three feet high and nearing the top of their seats. Within seconds, another car piled on top of theirs.
The couple fled their vehicle, initially hanging onto a tree as trash cans, car wheels, sofas and chairs streamed by in the  [raging floodwaters](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/29/world/europe/rain-spain-cold-drop-dana.html) .
“It was like an apocalypse,” he said.
They were hardly alone. Thousands of people found themselves trapped in one way or another — in cars, in trucks, and in homes — as heavy rainfall pounded southern Spain early this week.
At least  [95 people have died](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/world/europe/spain-floods-valencia.html) , and others are still missing, but how many remains unclear. Rescuers feared finding more bodies, said Margarita Robles, Spain’s defense minister, as they  [dug deeper](https://www.nytimes.com/video/world/europe/100000009791927/deadly-flash-floods-spain-killed-rescue.html)  into the mud.
Rain continued to fall overnight and into Thursday morning in eastern and southern Spain, as cities and towns in eastern Spain surveyed the damage.
In Castelló, the  [country’s weather agency warned](https://twitter.com/avamet/status/1851886019106242593?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851886019106242593%7Ctwgr%5E50927fc97dbdf7e45b4d426c5694eb41db7ee696%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felpais.com%2Fespana%2F2024-10-31%2Fultima-hora-de-la-dana-en-directo.html)  that rivers and streams could overflow. Some districts of Valencia and Catalonia remained on high alert, with  [more rain expected](https://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/prediccion/avisos)  during the day, the weather agency said.
Thousands of households were still without electricity or a phone connection, the authorities said. More than a dozen municipalities reported having no clean drinking water, emergency services in Valencia said.
Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez was expected to visit the worst affected areas, after  [the government declared](https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Paginas/2024/301024-comunicado-luto-dana.aspx)  three days of national mourning. His opponent, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, will also visit the areas.
In and around the city of Valencia, water had gushed into ground-floor apartments, trapping some people. It flooded shopping centers, dog shelters and even a nursing home, killing some of its residents. Other victims died in places where it did not rain, swept away by roaring waters.

On Wednesday, as coroners worked to identify the bodies, some of the hardest-hit villages remained cut off, the roads and bridges that connected them to the rest of the country broken or inundated by the flash floods. 
Dozens of roads remains closed, including major highways, the Civil Guard said. Three of Valencia’s subway lines have collapsed, and train service will be suspended for three weeks, said Óscar Puente, the transport minister.Sign up for Your Places: Extreme Weather.Get notified about extreme weather before it happens with custom alerts for places in the U.S. you choose.

Assessing the damage in Valencia, Mr. Puente said “the entire regional road network is seriously damaged.”
As communities remain cut off, the authorities have deployed security forces to guard against looting. In at least one town, a lack of drinking water had led to skirmishes, local news outlets reported.
Thousands of trucks and cars were abandoned on streets and highways, buried in thick layers of mud, as underpasses were filled with water. Their owners were stranded in makeshift shelters, unable to make it home.
Victims of the flooding in Valencia will receive a minimum of 6,000 euros, about $6,500, as part of a €250 million aid package  [announced by](https://twitter.com/carlos_mazon_/status/1851907550398001278)  Carlos Mazon, the leader of the Valencia region.
Toni Zamorano, 59, sat on the ground outside a basketball hall in Valencia that had been turned into a dormitory. He was driving home when his car filled with water on Tuesday night. He pushed his door open and jumped into the water. Within a few minutes, he saw that his car had been completely covered in water and was floating away.
“I started swimming, walking, swimming,” he said. He was alone on a stretch of flooded highway, with the water up to his chest, as sofas, computers and cars floated by.
“Cars were like boats,” he said. “I honestly thought it was all over.”
Mr. Zamorano lives in the village of Sedavi, a few kilometers south of Valencia. He has not been able to make it home yet.
“I don’t know what I’m going to find,” he said. “My whole town must be devastated, and I don’t know what my home is like.”

Mr. Hernandez, 56, did not make it to his mother’s funeral. His wife eventually managed to cling onto a lamppost, but he did not, and was carried away. He tried to grab floating tires and poles until he managed to enter a bus that was stuck in the stream. The upper part of the bus was still dry, and he took off his wet clothes and wrapped himself in its curtains.
At about 4 a.m. on Wednesday, rescuers came for him. For hours, he had no idea what had happened to his wife.
He did not have his cellphone, and none of the emergency workers he spoke to had any information. Mr. Hernandez and his wife have known each other since they were both children, and they had been married nearly 30 years.
Finally, on Wednesday morning, he called his brother, and got the news he was waiting for: She was alive. She also blamed him for not holding onto the lamppost as she did, and drifting away in the current, his brother said.
If she was complaining about him “It’s a sign she is doing well,” Mr. Hernandez said with a laugh, as he stood smoking outside a sports hall while wearing a sweater from the local basketball team that the rescuers had given him.
Inside, the eight courts had been turned into a dormitory, with dozens of mattresses laid geometrically below the backboards still bearing a score from the last game played there, 24.
Nuria Molio, 51, her brother, and her father were sitting together on one of the mattresses. They had just come out from an oncology checkup on her 84-year-old father when water came gushing into their car.
Rescuers had to extract them with a rope so that they would not be swept away. They spent the night under a bridge in the highway, with other dozens of people in their damp clothes.
“I was afraid that the water would take us all,” Ms. Molio said.
Leaders around the world, particularly in Europe, sent messages of support as images of Spain’s devastation spread.
“I want to express my closeness to the people of Valencia,” Pope Francis said. “I am close to them in this moment of catastrophe. I pray for them.”
