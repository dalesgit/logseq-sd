- Currently, the group is discussing *Crones Don't Whine: Concentrated Wisdom for Juicy Women, *by Jean Shinoda Bolen. Forget about getting old, aging gracefully is all about perspective. As Dr. Bolen explains, crone years are "growing" years in women's lives. In this new stage, women can finally devote their time, energy, and creativity to what really matters to them.
