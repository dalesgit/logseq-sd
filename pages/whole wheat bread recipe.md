- ### Instructions
  ​
- Layer your ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the following order: Water, Butter/Oil, Salt, Sugar, Flour, and lastly, Yeast.
- Add the bread pan to the bread machine, and make sure that it’s secured. Close the lid, and plug in the machine. Choose the wholemeal or whole wheat bread setting, medium size, and start the machine.
- The bread machine will now take over for you, and knead, proof, and bake your bread dough!
- When the baking cycle ends, unplug the bread machine, open the lid, and remove the pan from the machine with kitchen mitts. Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then shake it out of the pan and allow it to cool completely. Carefully remove the paddle from the bottom of the loaf if it got stuck there.

- ### Notes
  ​
- **Warm Water:** When making bread it’s best to have all ingredients at room temperature to start. The water should be a bit above that, at 110°F/45°C, in order to activate the yeast.
- **You Can Sift the Flour:** Sifting flour before making bread with it helps to aerate it, and will make a fluffier, less dense bread. It’s not necessary for success but is an option.
- You will get a medium 1 and ½ lb or 750g loaf.
- **Nutrition:** Calculated is just a rough estimate for the smallest loaf if it’s sliced into 10 slices. Info is per slice.
