## Week 1 

> Remember that these rules were written for someone who is guiding another.
> 
>  what kind of things will lead you to quit? (cf. MP Dave at gym. Fewer people this past week because New Year's resolutions are failing)

1. Rule. Seduction of the spirit. Good spirit causes pain. 
2. good spirit gives **Shalom**
3. definitions of desolation / consolation
4. further re. desolation. n.b. the "depression" is not medical depression. Feeling desolation but presence of God. e.g.
5. When in desolation, don't change anything you've already decided. common advice.
6. Don't be passive in desolation. Double-down on the movement toward God. Prayer / Penance.
7. God is always with us. Not alone. cf. "snow-plow parenting" = removing all obstacles from a child's path.
8. Be patient. keep up the positive practice
9. We might have a hand in our own desolation. Challenge by God to strengthen our faith. cf. Cardinal Bernardin was accused of sexual misconduct, until the accuser came forward and admitted to lying. That and the prostate CA led him to humility and deeper trust in God. Was the pain of it a consolation. 
10. Enjoy consolation while it lasts. Cf. Jesus at his final meal -- eating drinking express love to friends and Passion is approaching.
11. Be humble. It's all about God, not us.
12. Resist the bully and face it head on.
13. Resist the urge to keep problems **secret**. Cf. e.g. making a "spiritual" decision but failing to share that with spouse.
14. Know your weak points.

## Week 2

- evil one with doubts …
- consolation with no apparent cause are from God
- false consolations …  "slow down" LS: when doing the 25 years ago the exercises. She had so much consolation. "I want more. More time and prayer." She had toddler and pregnant -- she couldn't meet the demands she placed on herself. She couldn't meet expectations she placed on herself (it was her not God)
- Evil spirit may appear as the "light". If entering seminary out of sense that it's a more perfect life -- but maybe not. Friend of alcoholic who gets obsessed with fixing them. A person fails at something because they were at a "retreat". Doing something that is godly but not at all what God intends for them. Right mission but timing is wrong. Slow down. Talk to someone.
- 5-7 examine the consolation. Learn from mistakes Review. Ignatian while hearing a confession never asked about the sin, but "What were you doing (feeling) just before the sin?" False spirit is noisy. True spirit is like feather, light, Pay attention to the way the consolation came in.
- 8) Don't make a quick decision in the afterglow. Remind selves we are fallible. False spirit will try to use our "ego".

## How to use your imagination

- How change perception of a decision?
- Write about it as if you were a 3rd person. 
    - remind self that the goal of life is praise, reverence and service God. Ask God for grace.
    - Ask God to speak through your imagination
- Imagine
    - imagine you are a trusted advisor, what would encourage them to do
    - imagine you are at end of life, which path would you have wanted to take. e.g. look back decisions in your 20's.
    - Imagine yourself at last judgment. From that vantage how would you wish to have decided.
- Use imagination to test the decision. e.g. imagine that you have left your spouse … -- live out what you are contemplating.

## Using intellect, rational thinking.

> 3 categories of decisions when looking to see God. Certainty, ping-pong, tranquil state. Each of them is a mix of emotions and intellect.

- Mode 1:God works on our will. Filled with certainty. 
- Mode 2: emotions in turmoil. We're restless. Notice. Discuss with director. try other options. Seek confirmation (live with it).

State the choice concretely. Pray for inner freedom. Gather all necessary information. Is it a decision you have the right to make (going into convent). You need sufficient information to make an intelligent decision. You need sufficient information to make an intelligent decision.. Pray for freedom again.

Christine will send us a tool to help with this Mode.
