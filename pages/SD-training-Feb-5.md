- [[Faith Styles notes]]
- Notes for the day
	- [[Jim Gray]] is returning to the church. LS knew him some time ago when he did module 1 and then dropped out. It was important to him that his SD be a priest
	- Anne
		- "Pray as you go" is an Ignatian daily post. https://pray-as-you-go.org/
		- Song *come be with me* by Keith Duke
		- Poem by Linda Ferenbacher sp?
		- talked about shifting from pastor to SD
		- Anne lived time in Hawai'i
		- Nina (and Craig) Methodists who are going through alienation and separation now. Presbyterians (Cherrie) did that a while ago.
		- LS: reaching out to e.g. rigid traditionalists: this is like ... as other is to ... (analogy).
		- Anne: woman who had come to her who had witnessed husband sexually assaulting child. "I can't forgive him" thought the church said she must submit to husband.
	- Anne knew someone who once had been intrusive and hard as a new Christian. Year later now he's moderate considerably. Importance of safety and trust in the activity of God.
	- Allison used to feel heaviness in talking with someone from other faith style. Not so much any more. More accepting of me in my own skin.
	- Anne: waiting and patience have a major role in SD. Asking "Where is this directee finding life?"
	- Theology can be  black and white. Go to psychology or experience and it may open up reflection.
	- Shea had a problem with a musician who asked, "Do you not believe in hell?" She glad for awareness of faith styles comes up in various settings, not just SD.
	- Cherrie: a teacher who described **orthodoxy** as being like a ball field. Balls can be hit far, short, right field, left field. It's about setting where the hit becomes a foul.
	- Craig: in some cases the style works for the individual but not for those around her.
	- LS: maybe they are not even remorseful. Ask "what would be your desire for things?"
	- Shea: What works for a person in some settings but not in other settings.
	- LS: It's all about what's going on within ourselves. (cf. her ability to have SDee who who strongly contrary to her experience with 2 trans children)
	- Cherrie: Benee Brown says, "If **shame** worked I'd use it, but it doesn't work."
	- LS: When we have buttons pushed: shadow side, seeing something of my past in you that's not healed, overly inflated ego, or event of the past  -- that gives the area that we have to work on. Anne: when something makes us uncomfortable.
	- When we are triggered we're not quite 100% present, listening.
