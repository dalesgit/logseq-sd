Smart Thermostat Premium includes a built-in air quality sensor. Learn more about how it works and what it monitors, answers to other frequently asked questions, tips on improving your home’s air quality, and more.

## How it works

### What indoor quality indicators does Smart Thermostat Premium look for?

Your Smart Thermostat Premium can measure VOCs and estimate CO2. After a calibration period when you first install the thermostat, the thermostat’s relative air quality sensor measures the levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) around your thermostat.

Based on the VOC measurement, it can also estimate carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The sensor doesn’t directly measure CO2 but assesses CO2 levels based on the average correlation between VOCs and CO2 in exhaled human breath.

### What is a relative sensor, and how does it compare to an absolute sensor?

Unlike an absolute sensor that bases its measurements on a set reference point, a relative sensor's readings are based on the air quality it's exposed to.

The indoor air quality sensor inside your Smart Thermostat Premium is a relative sensor. It estimates the indoor air quality based on the ranges of air quality it has seen previously in your home. As you expose the sensor to more variations in air quality (like good air from the outdoors or poor air from cooking), it gets better at estimating your indoor air quality.

### Where can I view my air quality scores?

See your air quality scores on the thermostat and ecobee app.

Tapping on the Air Quality Score on the Thermostat Home Screen opens the Indoor Air Quality Details screen (below). The score can be Poor, Fair, or Clean and the color-coded status bar gives a more precise measure of air quality.

Below the status bar, you will see the estimated pollutant levels broken out by type—VOCs and CO2. Pollutant levels are assigned a score, ranging from Low to Moderate to High.

### How can seasonal change affect my air quality readings?

Smart Thermostat Premium estimates the indoor air quality based on the ranges of air quality it has seen in the home over the past four days. During the spring and fall, we tend to open or close windows more and rely on the HVAC system less. Opening and closing windows expose the sensor to a wider variety of air quality, which can result in more poor air quality readings. This is normal. The sensor accurately detects that air quality is less healthy when windows are closed versus open.

**What you can do**

* After your windows have been closed for a few days, the sensor will recalibrate, and you should receive fewer air quality notifications.
* Optionally, you can temporarily [disable air quality notification settings](https://support.ecobee.com/s/articles/How-can-I-disable-ecobee-notifications-on-my-phone).

## FAQs

### What do the air quality readings mean?

#### Clean

Indoor air quality is excellent. No action is needed.

#### Fair

Indoor air quality is okay. There is no need for concern. If possible, open a window to bring fresh air into the home and reduce VOC or CO2 levels.

#### Poor

We recommend ventilation. If possible, open a window to bring fresh air into the home and reduce VOC or CO2 levels.

#### Ventilation Options

Extreme cold and hot, humid weather can mean opening a window or door isn’t always an option. If the climate isn't conducive, try improving indoor air quality by replacing the furnace filter, adding plants, or investing in a ventilator like an ERV (effective for hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters).

### Why is my air quality poor?

Here are some of the top reasons why the thermostat may be reporting poor air quality in your home:

* High occupancy in the area around the thermostat
* Exposure to VOCs due to activities like cooking, cleaning with strong-smelling products, painting, etc.
* Stagnant air
* Seasonal changes ([see note above](https://support.ecobee.com/s/articles/air-quality-sensor-faqs#seasonal-variations))

### Why does my indoor air quality sensor need time to calibrate?

This is automatic and typically takes less than an hour but can take up to eight hours. Opening a window may help with a quicker calibration.

**<u>Good to know:</u>**

The air quality sensor will take longer than usual to calibrate when it hasn’t been exposed to enough variation in air quality.

You can try exposing your sensor to more variation in air quality by:

* Opening a door or window (as outdoor air quality is typically better than indoor air quality).
* Exposing the sensor to poor air quality:
  * Blow on it\*
  * Open a wine bottle near it
  * Open a strong-smelling cleaning product near it

\* The sensor is located on the back of the thermostat at the bottom.

### Can I disable the Air Quality Sensor?

**On the thermostat:**

## Answers to your health questions

### What are VOCs, and how can they affect my health?

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are gases emitted from natural sources and manufactured products. They are emitted into the air by many products we use around the home, such as:

* Cleaners and disinfectants like bleach, nail polish removed, isopropyl alcohol, vinegar
* Personal care products like deodorants, aerosol spray/hair gel, creams
* Paints and paint thinners, wood preservatives, wax
* Hobby crafts and glue
* Building materials, including flooring, carpet, pressed wood products
* New home furnishings
* Air fresheners
* Cosmetics
* Cigarettes
* Cooking gases and oils
* Pesticides
* Burning of fuels (wood-burning stoves, gas, kerosene lamps)
* Human breath and skin
* Outdoor sources (gasoline and diesel emissions, wood-burning)

Learn more about VOCs on the American Lung Association [website](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/at-home/indoor-air-pollutants/volatile-organic-compounds).

### Why does CO2 matter? And how can it impact my health?

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless, and non-flammable gas emitted into the indoor air mainly through human and animal breathing. It can also originate from other indoor sources like space heaters, dryers, stoves, vented and unvented heating and cooling appliances (HVAC), cigarette smoking, and infiltration by outdoor sources, like the burning of fossil fuels.

Exposure to higher-than-normal concentrations of CO2 results in a range of symptoms, like tiredness, headaches, dizziness, congestion, skin and eye irritation, and sore throat. For each measurable increase in carbon dioxide levels, the associated health effects worsen.<sup>1</sup>

### What can I do to improve my indoor air quality?

Given that Americans and Canadians spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors in homes, offices, schools, and other building environments, the concentration of VOCs and CO2 in the indoor environment is an important health consideration that can impact your family’s health. The main things you can do to improve indoor air quality are to ensure adequate ventilation and control indoor sources of CO2 and VOCs.

## Here are some of the top ways you can improve the air quality in your home

### Invest in a whole-home ventilator

You can also run (or invest in) an ERV (energy recovery ventilator) or an HRV (heat recovery ventilator) to bring fresh outdoor air in and remove stale air from inside the home. ERVs are the more effective option for hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters.

**<u>Good to know:</u>**

Smart Thermostat Premium can control compatible whole-home ventilation equipment. And if its indoor air quality sensor detects the air quality is poor, the thermostat can be set to automatically run the ventilator for 20 minutes to improve indoor air quality (Beta feature).

### Use a portable air purifier

Running an air purifier with an activated carbon filter can help remove VOCs and CO2 from the air. The lifespan between replacements can be short with carbon filters, perhaps making this a costly option.

### Open windows and doors

Ventilating your home can be as simple as opening a window or door to let some fresh air in. After opening a window, running a fan will better dilute the indoor air with the fresh outside air.

### Freshen the home and lift spirits with plants

Plants help reduce CO2 and boost your mood, concentration, and creativity. Red-edged dracaena, weeping fig, and bamboo palm are some of the best plants for filtering indoor air.

### Control sources of CO2 in and around your home

Have your fireplace regularly inspected to ensure proper ventilation.

Always use the range hood above your gas stove to vent away cooking odors and filter out smoke, grease, and harmful gases. When cooking and using the exhaust fan, consider opening a window to avoid pulling air from undesirable areas of your home.

Do not smoke in or near the home.

### Choose low-VOC products and reduce consumption of scented products

Opt for low-VOC paints and varnishes and minimize the use of scented products like diffusers, candles, and incense.

### Replace furnace filter

Opt for a higher-efficiency particulate filter (those with a rating of MERV 13), which can filter some common air pollutants found in cooking oil, smoke, and even smog.
