- *Over the years I have read many, many books about scripture, God, religion and spirituality. Some have resonated more than others. Sacred Journeys not only uses a Biblical reading each Sunday in worship, but also a non-Biblical reading to remind us that God continues to speak through the wisdom and insight of contemporary theologians, authors, poets and song-writers. Many of the books listed below have been used for these non-Biblical readings, but I've also found them to be good resources for my own spiritual journey.   * *~ Kaye*
