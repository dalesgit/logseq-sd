## Bump into baptism

[_Image of retreat center east of Chicago and small church ministry_] … having coffee with the designer of the chapel and the font.

The font was so refreshing with water running down a little rivulet into a small pool. You could easily put your hand down into the water – make the sign of the cross.

The architect told me he wanted people to **bump into their baptism** the moment they entered his chapel.

I immediately latched onto that phrase and thought “How perfect.”

I first bumped into my baptism with Owen’s baptism (my first child), then subsequently at the baptism of Julian, then their sister Miriam, etc.

Once my life reaches its end, my hope is that I will have not just **bumped into my baptism** but I will have **lived into the fullness of it**.

## Jesus baptism marks the beginning of his ministry

Jesus’ baptism by John is at the beginning of all the gospels. The gospels are not reporting to us biographical data about Jesus. They are preaching to us the good news of God’s work in the life of God’s people.

They are **good news** For people who need good news.

They are not biographies, they are proclamations, intended to create followers of the Risen Lord – otherwise known in later years as **Christians**

They all place this baptism at the beginning of the **Good News**

As a great bible story-teller once put it, while telling the story of the whole Bible – “The Bible begins like all good stories begin, with ‘Once upon a time…’”

So with the Gospels and their Good News, they begin the way the gospel has to begin – with Jesus’ baptism by John The evidence from the gospels demonstrates that the early church Gospel story-tellers were in fact scandalized by this part of the story, the part about Jesus being baptized by John at the beginning of his ministry.

Imagine: at the very beginning, from the very beginning, the Gospel has caused a **scandal**.

We might suspect, then, that where the gospel no longer scandalizes, it may have lost its connection to its origins.

The scandal in the case of the baptism is that Jesus – whom John himself said he had come to prepare the way for – he was but a servant to the one who was to come after – that it was John who baptized Jesus. The lesser, as it were, baptizing the greater.
