These qualities of Self are known in IFS as the eight Cs: calm, clarity, connection, creativity, courage, curiosity, confidence, and compassion. Other C words could also apply to Self, like consistency, care, and contemplation. The five Ps are playfulness, persistence, patience, perspective, and presence. One could also add peace and perceptiveness. The qualities of Self resemble the Galatians 5:22 description of the fruits of the Holy Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Honeycutt reminds us that the world’s three
