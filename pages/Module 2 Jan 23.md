- What's your decision, book. following the pattern of last week's discussion. Case studies that make it easy to understand. She will pass on the other resource she says is equally good to Liebert:
	- examples to fill our quiver.s
	- book" Discernment: Ways of Knowing by Elizabeth Liebert: https://a.co/d/d6SRQiK   $8:39 kindle edition. Cherrie used the book in her teaching ordination students.
	- Linda: "It's tough. 50/50 chance of survival (Paul, husband)
- Session
	- inchoate message / word from God. incl. body etc.
    - Mary Oliver: 
        It doesn’t have to be
        the blue iris, it could be
        weeds in a vacant lot, or a few
        small stones; just
        pay attention, then patch

        a few words together and don’t try
        to make them elaborate, this isn’t
        a contest but the doorway

        into thanks, and a silence in which
        another voice may speak.”
        ― Mary Oliver, Thirst
