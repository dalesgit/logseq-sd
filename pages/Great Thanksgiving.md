- Accept, O Lord, our thanks and praise for all that you have
  done for us. We thank you for the **splendor** of the whole
  creation, for the **beauty** of this world, for the **wonder** of life,
  and for the **mystery** of love.
- We thank you for the blessing of family and friends, and for
  the **loving care** which surrounds us on every side.
- We thank you for setting us at **tasks which demand our best
  efforts**, and for leading us to **accomplishments** which satisfy
  and delight us.
- We thank you also for those **disappointments** and failures
  that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on you alone.
- Above all, we thank you for your Son **Jesus Christ**; for the
  truth of his Word and the example of his life; for his steadfast
  obedience, by which he overcame temptation; for his dying,
  through which he overcame death; and for his rising to life
  again, in which we are raised to the life of your kingdom.
- Grant us the gift of your Spirit, that we may know him and
  make him known; and through him, at all times and in all
  places, **may give thanks to you in all things**.Â *Amen.*
