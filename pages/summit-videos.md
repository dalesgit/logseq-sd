## [The Radiance of Divine Darkness: Pseudo-Dionysius, Longings, and the Vulnerability of God with Carmen Acevedo Butcher](/home/dale/dwhelper/The Contemplative Summit-03.mp4)
What if one of the most influential voices in Christian mysticism has been nearly forgotten?

Pseudo-Dionysius, whose writings shaped centuries of contemplative thought (including Meister Eckhart and Thomas Aquinas!)-- remains largely unknown today. Yet his explorations of longing, divine union, and what he called "the radiance of divine darkness” reveal the vulnerable heart of God even to this day. 

Join award-winning translator Carmen Acevedo Butcher to explore Dionysius’ life, his lasting impact on Christian thought, and how his teachings invite us to embrace the unknown. What can we learn from his vision of divine darkness? And how does it speak to our deepest longings for connection with the Divine?

Join us as we uncover the enduring wisdom of this forgotten mystic.

## [Contemplation and Trauma: The Healing Power of Stillness with Tim Kelly ](/home/dale/dwhelper/The Contemplative Summit-02.mp4)
What happens when silence becomes a path to healing? Join us in conversation with Tim Kelly, a meditation teacher and oblate of the World Community for Christian Meditation, as we explore the profound intersection of trauma, healing, and contemplative practice. Tim’s work with refugees and marginalized communities provides a powerful lens into how meditation can offer solace and strength in the face of unspeakable suffering.

In this session, we’ll dive into Tim's experiences working with those whose lives have been shattered by trauma, exploring the delicate balance between when silence heals and when it might hurt. How do you know when someone’s nervous system is ready for silence, and how do you support them when it’s too much? We’ll also discuss the secondary trauma Tim has faced in his work and how his own contemplative practice has helped him remain grounded in the midst of so much pain.

Whether you are a meditation practitioner or someone interested in the intersection of spirituality and trauma recovery, this session will offer a compassionate exploration of how contemplative practices can open the door to healing, even in the most difficult circumstances.

## [Radical Welcome: Ignatian Spirituality & Queer Christians-James Martin S.J.](/home/dale/dwhelper/The Contemplative Summit-05.mp4)
What does it mean to extend love and welcome to those who feel most excluded, especially within a Church that has often been a source of pain?

In this conversation with Fr. James Martin, we’ll explore how spirituality can be more inclusive, especially for those who feel alienated by traditional religion. We’ll dive into the wisdom of Ignatian spirituality, discovering how it offers tools for seekers both inside and outside the Church, and why the story of Lazarus offers profound lessons about letting go and new beginnings.

Fr. Jim will also share insights from his experience in Pope Francis' Synod and his vision for a Church that embraces vulnerability and compassion, even in the face of resistance. How can we create spiritual spaces that welcome everyone? What does it mean to "come forth" into a new way of being?

In this session, join Carmelite friar Matthew Blake to explore the paradoxes of the contemplative life. Together, we’ll discuss how authentic living allows love and virtue to flow naturally, the role of suffering in spiritual maturity, and why the spiritual journey is less about achievement and more about embracing the unknown.

He talks about the qualities of true elders, the long journey to becoming one, and how divine union (theosis) leads us to embrace everyone and everything as Beloved.

## 09 Michael Petrow [Health-Bestowing Wounds: Wisdom from Origen of Alexandria with Michael Petrow](/home/dale/dwhelper/The Contemplative Summit-09.mp4)
What if the roots of Christian mysticism run deeper than most of us realize? In this episode, I’m joined by Dr. Michael Petrow, a Jungian scholar, spiritual director, and Director of Formation at the Center for Action and Contemplation, to explore the profound and often overlooked teachings of Origen of Alexandria.

Origen, an early Church Father from the 3rd century, was one of the first great Christian mystics, though today he remains largely forgotten. His writings—especially on the mystical union with God—have influenced countless spiritual giants, yet his name is rarely spoken in modern Christian circles.

In this conversation, we will explore Origen’s reflections on divine union, his allegorical reading of Scripture, and his radical belief in universal salvation. We’ll also dive into his fascinating concept of “health-bestowing wounds,” and how our deepest pains can become sources of profound wisdom.

How might Christianity have evolved differently if Origen had shaped its trajectory rather than figures like Augustine? What wisdom can Origen still offer to us today, especially in a world longing for healing and spiritual depth? Join us for a fascinating exploration of the ancient mystical tradition that continues to inspire seekers today.

## 10 [Surrender, Not Perfection: The True Path to Divine Union with Michelle Jones](/home/dale/dwhelper/The Contemplative Summit-10.mp4)
What happens when we let go of our desire for a "beautiful" spiritual life?

What if the path to divine union is not filled with mystical experiences or profound moments of peace but rather marked by emptiness, helplessness, and surrender?

In this session, we sit down with author Michelle Jones to explore the wisdom of Ruth Burrows, a Carmelite spiritual writer whose insights have been compared to those of Julian of Norwich and Thérèse of Lisieux.

Michelle takes us deep into Burrows' teachings on spiritual poverty, mysticism, and divine union—offering myth-busting clarity on what it means to truly surrender to God. We discuss how Burrows challenges our desire to craft a “spiritually beautiful” life, warning us about the subtle trap of prioritizing our spiritual image over genuine surrender. We'll also explore Burrows’ view that mysticism has nothing to do with extraordinary experiences and everything to do with accepting our powerlessness.

If you’ve ever felt that your spiritual life is lacking because it isn’t filled with dramatic moments, this conversation might just offer the liberation you need.

## 13 [Navigating the Inner Wilderness with Celtic Saints with Justin Coutts](/home/dale/dwhelper/The Contemplative Summit-13.mp4)
What if the ancient stories of Celtic saints weren’t just historical accounts but living symbols, offering us guidance for the challenges we face today? In this conversation with contemplative writer and spiritual director Justin Coutts, we’ll explore how the rich symbolism of the Celtic tradition intersects with the modern practice of Internal Family Systems (IFS). Justin, abbot of the online community In Search of a New Eden, invites us to contemplate the lives of saints like St. Brigid, St. Columbanus, and St. David of Wales—not for their historicity, but for the deep spiritual meanings they hold.

Drawing on his diverse spiritual background—including Canadian indigenous traditions, Quakerism, Wiccan, and Christianity—Justin reveals how these saints’ stories can serve as archetypes, illuminating parts of our inner selves. We’ll discuss how symbols like wolves, angels, and even the wilderness itself can offer powerful tools for healing and self-discovery, and how these stories can be used to navigate inner conflicts, trauma, and moral injury. We’ll also delve into the practice of consolation, detachment, and how these ancient teachings offer both comfort and challenge in a modern, fast-paced world.

What can the voices of long-gone female mystics offer our modern world? Shannon Evans believes their wisdom still speaks loud and clear. In this conversation, Shannon takes us on a journey through the lives of six remarkable women mystics.

## 22 How to Give Your Death Away: The Final Act of Generosity with Ronald Rolheiser
What does it mean to age gracefully and make our death a gift to others? Join us as we sit down with award-winning author and spiritual director Ronald Rolheiser to explore the final stage of life—one that often lacks clear guidance in Christian spirituality. Drawing on the wisdom of mystics like John of the Cross, Rolheiser helps us understand how we can approach aging with grace, and why passivity in old age can still be deeply generative.
