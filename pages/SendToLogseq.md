	- A friend recently asked: “Do you think the United States will survive the anger of white men?” As blunt as the question is, the core element is not so far-fetched. In fact, the [majority of white men](https://www.nbcwashington.com/decision-2024/2024-voter-turnout-election-demographics-trump-harris/3762138/) (and [women](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/granderson-theres-no-mystery-white-women-handed-trump-the-election/ar-AA1tFTmN?ocid=BingNewsSerp)) who voted in the presidential election in 2024 have rallied around a man who has called for the “[termination of the constitution](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/politics/trump-constitution-truth-social/index.html)”, vowed to be a “[dictator](https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72)”, and threatened to [deploy the US military](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/11/06/trump-won-heres-what-could-mean-military.html) against Americans. They support a man who is a [convicted felon](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/31/g-s1-2024/trump-trial-verdict-analysis), an [adjudicated rapist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/trump-carroll-judge-rape/), a proven [liar](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/535081-wapost-counts-30573-false-or-misleading-claims-in-four-years-by-trump/), who has been fined nearly [half a billion dollars](https://apnews.com/article/trump-civil-fraud-verdict-attorney-general-cf9df608a576d561393b4ceeac4cae3a) for fraud, who [incited an insurrection](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-capitol-riot-probe-turns-focus-trump-allies-extremist-groups-2022-07-12/) that [injured 140 police](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-union-says-140-officers-injured-in-capitol-riot/2021/01/27/60743642-60e2-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html) officers, and who [mismanaged](https://www.businessinsider.com/analysis-trump-covid-19-response-40-percent-us-deaths-avoidable-2021-2) the Covid-19 pandemic causing hundreds of thousands to die needlessly.
	- The fact that Donald Trump’s candidacy was even viable, given that horrific track record, was because of the support of white men. White men, whose anger was [on full display](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/us/trump-msg-rally.html) at Madison Square Garden as they spewed racist, misogynistic venom. White men who [attacked poll workers](https://www.ibtimes.com/south-carolina-poll-worker-attacked-maga-hat-3749000) and also [voters](https://www.cleveland.com/nation/2024/10/teen-trump-supporter-uses-machete-to-threaten-harris-supporters-at-polls-in-florida-police-say.html) of Kamala Harris. White men [who chafed at the thought](https://www.salon.com/2024/11/05/bracing-for-magas-backlash-the-strategy-behind-secret-kamala-harris-is-safety/) that their wives and girlfriends would not vote for the man who thought it was “[a beautiful thing](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-says-its-a-beautiful-thing-to-watch-states-ban-abortion_n_666200c9e4b0c7a620db3ccf)” that reproductive rights had been destroyed. And, as the New York Times reported, the downwardly mobile, frustrated “white men [without a degree](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/upshot/census-relative-income.html), [who] have been surpassed in income by college-educated women”.
	- And let’s be clear. Trump has laid out an agenda that will provide the “[wages of whiteness](https://items.ssrc.org/reading-racial-conflict/beyond-the-wages-of-whiteness-du-bois-on-the-irrationality-of-antiblack-racism/#:~:text=In%20Black%20Reconstruction%20in%20America1%2C%20Du%20Bois%20famously,social%20status%20derived%20from%20their%20classification%20as%20%E2%80%9Cnot-black.%E2%80%9D)” to his male supporters but very little else. The racist hate that [undergirds Maga](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/28/racism-survey-prri-maga-republicans/) can only provide threadbare comfort. The [planned](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cyrusfarivar/2024/11/06/trump-promised-more-tariffs-that-means-everything-will-get-more-expensive/) [enormous tariffs](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181327/trump-election-economy-tariffs-deportations), the rollback on [workplace](https://www.epi.org/publication/deregulation-year-in-review/), [food](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/15/project-2025-food-farming-policies) and [environmental](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/06/1106712/trumps-win-is-a-tragic-loss-for-climate-progress/) safety regulations, the [dismantling](https://www.propublica.org/article/donald-trump-agenda-working-class) of labor protections, the planned [deportation](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-vance-class-war-election.html) of tens of millions of undocumented people and [naturalized](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-mass-deportation-promise_n_6723d828e4b01f6919d97998) citizens, the assault on reproductive rights and [alignment with dictators](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/02/526520042/6-strongmen-trumps-praised-and-the-conflicts-it-presents) – all of this will destroy the [economy](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/19/politics/trump-mass-deportation-cost-cec/index.html), explode the deficit and leave the United States severely isolated and weakened.
	- This is nothing new. White male anger, especially at the nation’s inclusion of African Americans, has repeatedly privileged white supremacy over the viability of the United States. During the war of independence, when the nation was fighting to become the United States, South Carolina’s government fumed at Congress’s request to arm the enslaved and give them their freedom in exchange for fending off a British force that was more than 10 times the size of what those in Charleston could muster. Government officials flat out refused and barked that they weren’t sure that the US “was a nation worth fighting for” and would rather take their chances with the king of England. In short, enslaving those of African descent was infinitely more important than the United States.
	- Later on, during the subsequent battles over drafting the constitution, far too many white slaveholding men were willing to hold the United States hostage unless they got their way. That meant reinforcing slavery and the power of slaveholders, despite the document’s language about “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. They threatened. They raged. They schemed. And they succeeded.
	- The three-fifths clause, which partially counted each enslaved human being by that fraction, gave the slaveholding south disproportionate and unearned power in the US House of Representatives. The Fugitive Slave Clause allowed them to hunt down beyond their state borders those seeking that elusive freedom from bondage. The additional 20 years of the Atlantic Slave Trade meant they could secure more human cargo directly from Africa to engorge the coffers of those placing racialized slavery above democracy.
	- The disastrous contradictions embedded in the founding of the United States could not help but erupt into civil war. Once again, a group of white men [were angry](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states). Angry that the country [had elected a man](https://nerd.wwnorton.com/ebooks/epub/amerele3hs/EPUB/content/4.1.5-chapter13.xhtml) who did not want to see slavery spread beyond the South. Angry that Abraham Lincoln’s position meant a diminution of the south’s national political power. Angry that Lincoln was a Republican, a party founded on anti-slavery. So, in cold, calculated anger they attacked the United States of America. They set out to destroy it.
	- They did not succeed. But that war sowed the dragon’s teeth that [undermined the promise](https://books.google.com/books?id=W_yKDwAAQBAJ\&printsec=frontcover\&source=gbs_ge_summary_r\&cad=0#v=onepage\&q\&f=false) of a true multi-racial democracy and led to the horrors of Jim Crow. When the need for correcting the US’s decidedly unequal democracy ran headlong into the threat of nuclear annihilation during the cold war, the choice should have been obvious. But, once again, white men’s anger put the United States in jeopardy.
	- In 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik, a satellite, which proved that the USSR unexpectedly had the capabilities to launch its nuclear arsenal across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The US [was no longer safe](https://www.nytimes.com/1957/10/13/archives/us-missile-experts-shaken-by-sputnik-weight-of-satellite-called.html?searchResultPosition=1). President Dwight Eisenhower responded by proposing the National Defense Education Act, which would pump hundreds of millions of dollars into universities so the US would have the “[brainpower to fight](https://books.google.com/books?id=lTKQAAAAMAAJ\&q=Brainpower+to+fight+the+cold+war\&dq=Brainpower+to+fight+the+cold+war\&hl=en\&newbks=1\&newbks_redir=0\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwiClPSSocmJAxXqRTABHSyZAdoQ6AF6BAgFEAI) the cold war”.
	- The bill was shepherded through Congress by two Alabama legislators, the representative Carl Elliott and the senator J Lister Hill. Both wanted the money but neither wanted what came with it. In other words, they wanted to continue to deny admission to African Americans to their racially exclusive universities, such as Ole Miss, LSU, the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama. If this was about educating those who could give the US an edge in the cold war, then limiting that access by [race was folly](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/24/517784975/katherine-johnson-nasa-mathematician-and-an-inspiration-for-hidden-figures-dies).
	- Yet Elliott and Hill, both signatories to the virtually insurrectionist [Southern Manifesto](https://www.naacpldf.org/brown-vs-board/southern-manifesto-massive-resistance-brown/), which vowed to use every weapon at the congressional membership’s disposal to stop Brown v Board of Education from darkening their states’ doorsteps, refused to move the bill forward. They demanded, instead, that Eisenhower provide assurances that those hundreds of millions of dollars would be as whites-only as their universities. Faced with the dilemma of Jim Crow or possible nuclear annihilation, the angry white men chose to protect Jim Crow, not the United States.
	- Similarly, today, despite the warnings from [generals](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/us/politics/trump-administration-criticism.html) who served with Trump, [police officers](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/he-betrayed-us-officers-who-protected-the-capitol-grapple-with-trump-s-return/ar-AA1tDmp3?ocid=BingNewsSerp) who endured the attacks on January 6, and a God-fearing then [vice-president](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/15/politics/pence-will-not-endorse-trump/index.html) Mike Pence who was targeted for a [hanging](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/25/trump-expressed-support-hanging-pence-capitol-riot-jan-6-00035117) with gallows constructed during the insurrection, the angry white men who propped up Trump’s return to the White House ignored everything they say they valued – the military, law enforcement and God – to give into the rage of [white grievance](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/who-buys-the-big-lie-white-racial-grievance-and-confidence-in-the-fairness-of-american-elections/4BB3B6F641B41D8B63D152F9779C64CE), the “[pastiche of sweaty anger](https://www.threads.net/@mediaite/post/DCAGpVJSg5t?xmt=AQGzR1jqZSb4RvMritzc7_vaD7yV6JX0zBYbVR7uJ_7ib32BXw)” that the Trump-Vance campaign peddled, and to the fear and violence embedded in the [“great replacement” theory](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-is-great-replacement-theory-and-how-does-it-fuel-racist-violence).
	- Once again, unfortunately, the anger about a multi-racial democracy has put the viability of the United States in jeopardy.
