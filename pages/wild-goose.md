We are made in Christ to fly not walk about

Living into our baptism, like Jesus living into his, means living heroic lives. The calling requires extraordinary lives of **blessing, forgiveness, service, prayer.**

“Come to the edge,“ he said.  
”We can’t, we’re afraid!“ they responded.  
”Come to the edge,“ he said.  
”We can’t, We will fall!“ they responded.  
”Come to the edge," he said.  
And so they came.  
And he pushed them.  
And they flew.”

― Guillaume Apollinaire
