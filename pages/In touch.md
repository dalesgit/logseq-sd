- Ch. 4
	- witnessing to what's going on, to our thought
	- Is it different for women?
	- Where do we carry our feelings? in our body?
	- Limiting beliefs.
	- when our body is responding to us (cf. Whitehead) it is often **yelling**
	- look for constriction and expanding
		- Do I feel open about ... Am I shrinking back from ...
	- Craig said that it was similar to the Welcoming Prayer (that he seemed familiar with)
	- **projection of what we see in others, judge in others** -- something you hate about yourself
		- e.g. she's introvert, doesn't like to talk, when people talk and talk so much ... irritating
	- **Heart is closer to the truth than the head**
		- daily practice of **focusing** as discussed in the chapter
- ## techniques
	- Our thoughts as well as our feelings are not **who we are**
	- bio-physical focusing, soul-collage, centering prayer, inner child work, IFS, any creating expression (**Carol next session**)
	- visual journaling
	- dialog with your inner critic
	- Alison: in therapy a tapping on your head when you work with early traumatic experiences. thoughts and feelings are energy that can get stuck. Tapping is releasing the energy. (Chinese?) cp. EST, Danny (tones, vibration)
	- Nina & Danny have done tapping
	- Reiki ??
