  House Democrats are turning [President Trump](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump)'s controversial Madison Square Garden rally and House Speaker [Mike Johnson](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/30/mike-johnson-early-voting-congress-trump)'s (R-La.) comments about the Affordable Care Act into their de facto closing message.
  
  **Why it matters:** The 2024 election is heading for a photo finish, and Democrats believe their foes just gave them a critical leg up.
  
  **Driving the news:** Democrats running in districts with large Puerto Rican populations were quick to jump on comedian Tony Hinchcliffe's comparison of [Puerto Rico to an "island of garbage"](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-rally-comedian-puerto-rico-garbage-island) at Trump's rally on Sunday.
- Reps. [Susan Wild](https://x.com/wildforcongress/status/1850678758207852667) (D-Pa.) and [Jahana Hayes](https://x.com/JahanaHayesCT/status/1851035280574410844) (D-Conn.), former Rep. [Mondaire Jones](https://x.com/MondaireJones/status/1850702238458483012) (D-N.Y.) and New York Democratic candidate [Laura Gillen](https://x.com/LauraAGillen/status/1850704500454994099) all swiftly put out statements condemning the joke.
- Gillen's opponent, Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R-N.Y.), [condemned Hinchcliffe's rhetoric](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-rally-puerto-rico-new-york-republicans) — with the Trump campaign also backing away from it – but Gillen, in a statement to Axios, tied him to it anyway.
- "Anthony D'Esposito has given Trump a full-throated endorsement, cheered him on at every turn, and even rode in the motorcade with him this past weekend," she said.
  
  **What they're saying:** Wild, who is facing one of the most competitive reelection battles of the cycle, told Axios that the comment has resonated considerably in her district and could have a real impact on her race.
- "In the two days since offensive comments were made against Puerto Rico, I have heard from people across my community about how motivated they are to get out and vote," she said Wednesday.
- Wild added: "Voters in PA-07 pay attention to things like that, and I believe it will make a real difference in the election."
  
  **Zoom in:** Johnson, campaigning for Wild's opponent Ryan Mackenzie, handed Democrats another cudgel by appearing to criticize the Affordable Care Act.
- "No Obamacare. The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that," the speaker said, according to video reported by [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853).
- Democrats quickly seized on those comments, with House Majority PAC blasting out a [series of press releases](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25260367-hmp-oct-30-johnson-aca) pushing Republicans in key races to denounce or disinvite Johnson over the comments.
  
  **The other side: "**Despite the dishonest characterizations from the Harris campaign, the audio and transcript make clear that I offered no such promise to end Obamacare, and in fact acknowledged that the policy is 'deeply ingrained' in our health care system," Johnson said in a statement.
- He added that House Republicans "will always seek to reduce the costs and improve the quality and availability of health care for all Americans."
  
  **Yes, but:** Democrats are facing their own headwinds in the final stretch of the campaign, most notably a dispute over whether President Biden [called Trump supporters "garbage"](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/30/anxious-democrats-groan-at-bidens-garbage-comment) in response to Hinchcliffe's comments.
- Several Democratic lawmakers vented to Axios that the fracas has drawn attention from their party's closing message and illustrates why Biden has largely been sidelined from the campaign trail.
- A handful of Democrats running in key races, such as Reps. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Jared Golden (D-Maine), publicly denounced the remark.
