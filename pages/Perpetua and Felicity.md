> _Preface of a Saint (3)_

## The Collect

O God, the King of Saints, who strengthened your servants Perpetua, Felicity, and their companions to make a good confession and to encourage one another in the time of trial: Grant that we who cherish their blessed memory may share their pure and steadfast faith, and win with them the palm of victory; through Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. _Amen._

## The Epistle

### Hebrews 10:32–39

Recall those earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings, sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and persecution, and sometimes being partners with those so treated. For you had compassion for those who were in prison, and you cheerfully accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you yourselves possessed something better and more lasting. Do not, therefore, abandon that confidence of yours; it brings a great reward. For you need endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.

For yet "in a very little while,  
the one who is coming will come and will not delay;

but my righteous one will live by faith.  
My soul takes no pleasure in anyone who shrinks back."

But we are not among those who shrink back and so are lost, but among those who have faith and so are saved.

## The Psalm

### Psalm 124

#### Nisi quia Dominus

1 If the LORD had not been on our side, *  
let Israel now say;

2 If the LORD had not been on our side, *  
when enemies rose up against us;

3 Then would they have swallowed us up alive *  
in their fierce anger toward us;

4 Then would the waters have overwhelmed us *  
and the torrent gone over us;

5 Then would the raging waters *  
have gone right over us.

6 Blessed be the LORD! *  
he has not given us over to be a prey for their teeth.

7 We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; *  
the snare is broken, and we have escaped.

8 Our help is in the Name of the LORD, *  
the maker of heaven and earth.

## The Gospel

### Matthew 24:9–14

Jesus said, “They will hand you over to be tortured and will put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. Then many will fall away, and they will betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world, as a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come."

Savior of the world, by your cross and precious blood you have redeemed us;  
_Save us and help us, we humbly beseech you, O Lord._

_The Priest then lays hands upon the sick person, and says one of the following_

N., I lay my hands upon you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, beseeching our Lord Jesus Christ to sustain you with his presence, to drive away all sickness of body and spirit, and to give you that victory of life and peace which will enable you to serve him both now and evermore. _Amen._

_or this_

N., I lay my hands upon you in the Name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, beseeching him to uphold you and fill you with his grace, that you may know the healing power of his love. _Amen._
