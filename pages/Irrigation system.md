- On the Rainbird scheduler.

	- We chose to only water once starting at two in the morning. I want to see how one watering does for the lawn and what the cost is. He recommends a possible second watering during the dry time starting at 2 o’clock for only 20 minutes.
	- Issues are, for example, not giving enough sun heat time to evaporate.
	- The two watering times would be set on the runtimes option.
	- The rain sensor can be bypassed in two ways. One of them on the click receiver. The other on the Rainbird module.
- At the St. level valves.
	- He suggests checking the filter weekly at first. Partly because of the open nature of our reservoir, and all the dirt that gets passed.
	- When First getting into the unit, turn off the water from the city. Then open the cap to make sure that any excess pressure is released then unscrew the filter and clean it out as needed. Replace the cap.
	- There was settling going on with the cage, so it may go below the level of the new pipes. Lifted up and filled in the dirt.
- Heads
	- he said there were some heads that they couldn’t replace that had filters that were partly clogged. Something about the threads not fitting or something. I didn’t really understand.
	- They replaced a lot of the old heads with the sweeping heads.
	- He added a small shrub head on the side of the front flower bed.
	- Evidently, in the past, there were flowerbeds along the fence, because there are both sprinklers and sweeping heads.
	- They moved two heads on the left side to get better coverage.
