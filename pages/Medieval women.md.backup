  **POET, MYSTIC, WIDOW, WIFE: The Extraordinary Lives of Medieval Women,** by Hetta Howes
  
  ***
  
  - “Do you not realize that Eve is you?”
  
  That scathing question was uttered by Tertullian, an early Christian theologian, around 200 C.E.
  
  His misogyny echoed down the centuries. In medieval Europe — that is, between the 5th and the 15th centuries — male authors pondered: Were women like Eve, or the Virgin Mary? Either way, real women couldn’t win: They were either sinful, ruled by desire, irrational — or held to be impossibly pure and virtuous.
  
  In “Poet, Mystic, Widow, Wife,” the scholar Hetta Howes presents a history of medieval women’s lives as told through the prism of four exceptional individuals.
  
  Marie de France was a 12th-century poet, known for her collection of lais, narrative poems that celebrated courtly love. Julian of Norwich, an English anchorite walled into a cell in 1373, authored the spiritual tract “Revelations of Divine Love.” Christine de Pizan, a noblewoman at the French court, turned to writing after her husband died, and is best known today for her proto-feminist work, “The Book of the City of Ladies,” composed around 1405. And there is Margery Kempe, a 15th-century pilgrim and author of perhaps the first autobiography in English.
  
  Howes’s book proceeds thematically, so that — despite their unusual fame — each subject’s writing is used to illustrate an aspect of contemporaries’ ordinary lives. From childbirth to marriage and adultery; travel and work to friendship and power; a wide range of female experience is represented through the four women’s words. And throughout, the tensions of medieval womanhood strain and stretch — eroticism and purity, sexuality and motherhood, silence and speech.

  Howes is keen to note similarities between these women’s experiences and our own. After her first child was born, Margery Kempe suffered a spiritual crisis: she “dyspered of hyr lyfe,” believing that she would die. Howes suggests that this “sounds remarkably like postnatal depression.”
  
  But Kempe’s transformation of suffering into salvation is considerably weirder than a modern diagnosis of postpartum depression conveys. Her pain led to intensely erotic visions of God. She dressed all in white, and pressed nails into her skin to mimic Christ’s suffering and told her husband that she would rather see him murdered than have sex with him ever again.
  
  Medieval women made their flesh into pure meaning. In childbirth, they wrapped their bellies in silk and paper girdles inscribed with prayers and instructions: Count the drops of Christ’s blood that beaded the cross. Howes describes this as a distraction technique, akin to “hypnobirthing.” But, plainly, the women of this era did not *want* to look away from pain. Rather, they wished to make their suffering, the curse of Eve, into a pain as redemptive as Christ’s.
  
  At 30 years old, Julian of Norwich became gravely ill. But then she had a vision: She saw blood dripping down from the crown of thorns, “hote and freisly and ryth plenteously.” She saw Christ prise open the wound in his side wide enough that all of mankind could crawl in. She asked to be walled into a cell attached to a church, where she would live — praying, writing — for the rest of her days.
  
  Howes empathizes with Julian’s wish to “shut herself away to get some work done.” But medieval religious recluses weren’t overburdened modern women. They had funerals for their worldly selves; they were advised to dig their graves with their fingernails into the dirt floor of their cells. This is not a problem of lean-in feminism, but a culture that demands to be understood on its own terms. Julian used imagery of the suffering body to turn medieval misogyny on its head. What could be more powerful than a woman modeling her own form on the savior’s?
  
  Christine de Pizan was one of the earliest female philosophers, an imaginative and energetic critic of her own society. In “The Book of the City of Ladies,” she tells the stories of notable women — brave warrior queens, faithful wives, blessed saints — and offers careful rebuttals to the prejudices of her time. She was a master of allegory, a gorgeous and now almost-forgotten genre in which cities could be built not of stones but of stories. De Pizan was so much more than “the definition of a hustler” that the author labels her.
  
  Howes seems to want to flatten them all into women who might be our friends; to make them recognizable. They have postpartum depression and side hustles and need a moment to themselves. But that’s not empowering; that’s just a lack of imagination.
  
  By making over these women in our own image, we lose so much of what was distinctive and beautiful about their literature. “Here I write my name ‘Marie’ so that I will be remembered,” wrote Marie de France. We would do better to remember them as they were, in all of their humanity and strangeness.
