- Opening conversation from the article
  collapsed:: true
	- "*Original Blessing*"by Matthew Fox
	  collapsed:: true
		- Living the questions: "Original Sin" never occurred til 4th c.
			- Our value comes from Incarnation. Jesus took on the flesh so it must be good.
	- Nina: Shame is used to control people
	- Linda: Step 4 of 12 steps is not about things I've **done** rather the elements of **shame**. Name it is the power.
	- n.b. the things we might hear in SD (26)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Linda: "Truth-telling (about self) is so important in SD"
		- Caution against saying to someone that, "Yes I have felt that too" -- wanting them to share. **Linda says don't do that**! Cherrie "I have been taught that questions can produce **defensiveness**." Rather, e.g., "tell me more."
			- How we ask the questions makes a difference. Gentle ...
		- "What are the parts of you that you don't want to be seen."
		- "seldom feel..." talk about expectations, ... when didn't you feel?
		- What makes someone "good".
		- get at images of God?
		- point out the use of the word "ought" or "should" or "need". What means?
		- Craig: sees "resistance" "block" in SD is when they revert to Head-stuff, theology, e.g. "Original sin". Linda could respond: "How is that life-giving" to you?" People need to hit a "bottom" so that they have to make a change.
- Verbatim:
	- Yes/No questions can fall flat
	- The SD brought her own theological perspective,
	- Cherrie suggests that Linda share documents  (verbatim)so that we are not dependent: Google doc, share the link in chat, ...
	- In verbatim get the **skeleton** -- can't get everything.
	- "What is (God, Holy, Universe) telling you by bringing this to your attention today?"
	- Just leave it at "What does that feel like?" (simple, focus on SDee)
	- need to acknowledge, in a gracious manner, "Thank you for sharing with me ..."
	- Unpack the image of the poster board.
	- The theological questioning led to a loop that didn't go anywhere.
	- When do you draw attention to weeping? When let it go?
	- When do you make a referral? "Thank you for your authenticity. Sharing what you did. I feel like something important happened. You may want to consider seeking further therapy from someone. How should we ask God to be with you right now?
	- cf. Bene Brown *Gifts of imperfection* (with workbooks)
	- with re. **Enneagram** Christopher Huarte (with workbook)
