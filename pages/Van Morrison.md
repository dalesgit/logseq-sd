	- Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	  Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	- See me through the daytime
	  (See me through the daytime)
	  And through the long, lonely night
	  Lead me through the darkness
	  (Ooh-ooh-ooh) And on into the light
	- To stand with me when I'm troubled
	  (Stand with me when I'm troubled)
	  And help me through my strife
	  At times, get so uncertain, I turn to You
	  (Ooh-ooh-ooh) Turn to You in my young life
	- Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	  Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	- Someone to hold on to
	  (Someone to hold to)
	  And keep me from all fear
	  Someone to be my guiding light
	  (Ooh-ooh-ooh) And keep me ever dear
	- To keep me from all my selfishness
	  (Keep me from all selfishness)
	  To keepin' me from all my sorrow
	  To lead me onto givingness
	  (Ooh-ooh-ooh) So I can see a new tomorrow
	- Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	  Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	- Someone to walk with
	  Oh, someone to hold by the hand
	  Someone to talk with
	  Someone to understand
	  Eh (yeah)
	  Yeah (yeah)
	- To call on when I need You
	  (Call on when I need You)
	  And I need You very much
	  To open up my arms to You
	  (Feel Your tender touch) Feel Your tender touch
	- To feel it and to keep it
	  (Feel it and keep it)
	  Tuck it right here in my soul (yeah-yeah)
	  And care for it and keep it with me
	  (Never, never to grow old) Never to grow old
	- Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	  Lord, if I ever needed someone, I need You
	  One more time again
	  Lord, if I ever needed, needed someone, I need You
	  Lord, oh, if I ever needed someone, I need You
