- Video: Richard Schwartz
	- 30 min. link ... Becoming Whole: healing the exiled and rejected parts of ourselves
		- natural state is to be **multiple**
		- ask the **part**: "What do you want to know?" "What would happen if the part didn't work so hard?"
		- Richard did a meditation with interviewer
		- healing: witness what part went through (then), literally get the part out of there to a safe place, then to unburden (release)  the part from that time. Bring in the protector to show that it's ok.
		- internal practices for us to move to heaing?
			- people can get to know their protectors. Most people can't do it alone. Some can.
			- too often in the therapeutic community **the ego** becomes the bad guy.
			- Don't  try to get rid of the e.g. anxiety -- but get to know the part
			- culture creating personas out of trauma
			- "Don't tell me about your addiction, tell me about your pain." i.e. honor the pain order to discover new ways for the part to get what it needs
			- in family therapy people didn't get well. But they talked about all these "parts". [This was the origin of Schwartz's theory.]
		- These feels a lot like LS's strategies with me.
			- notice the things that trigger us. e.g. looking at Trump why trigger? My need to control, bully?
			- The self has a powerful desire to stand up to **injustice** -- cf. my present awareness. cf. what he calls "self" is what Buddhism calls "no-self".
