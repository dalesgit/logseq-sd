## opening

Each of us is gathered here this morning for a variety of reasons. Although there’s not a lot of youngsters, in other places, I’ve been it was the parents who told the young people that they would be in church. Others are here because it’s what they do every Sunday and they may even be aware that after the Christmas festivities, there is often a drop off in attendance.
For myself, there is the fact that father Peter had sent me a list of who would celebrate and preach through February and March. This was one of my Sundays and I make a concerted effort to do what I said I would do.

In the early centuries of the church on the day known as **theophany** or more recently **epiphany** (parenthesis ) in the eastern orthodox tradition, people would be in church because it was one of the most important festival days of the year, much more important than Christmas, for example.

One of us this weekend is in church because he wants to be baptized.

## Certificates

A bishop once did a show and tell. It was in a teaching on the meaning and importance of baptism. He had a way of explaining theological truths in ways that I could accept for my own. 

First he held up a certificate of ordination. See it's ornate frame, its size, the calligraphy which is real hand writing …

Then he held up a baptismal certificate.

> Most of them that I'm aware of are much smaller than this one. They're not usually framed. Most likely most of you have no idea where your baptismal certificate is.

But, as Bp. Ray said, we have the importance of these certificates **backwards.** It is the baptism that is far and away the most important. Ordination has one main purpose and that is to serve the community of the **baptized**.

## Epiphany (and Christmas)

> (from Orth Church in America) *The services of Epiphany are set up exactly as those of Christmas, although historically it was most certainly Christmas which was made to imitate Epiphany since it was established later.*

* *Epiphany means shining forth or manifestation. The feast is often called, as it is in the Orthodox service books, Theophany, which means the shining forth and manifestation of God. The emphasis in the present day celebration is on the appearance of Jesus as the human Messiah of Israel and the divine Son of God, One of the Holy Trinity with the Father and the Holy Spirit.*

The season – what in the Catholic church is called **ordinary time** – is not just, “Oh, back to wearing Green”. It links the power we have celebrated over the past weeks, the power of incarnation together with the responsibility each of us has as followers of the *Incarnate one*. The significance of who this child of God named **Jesus** is made manifest to us who choose to follow him and proclaim it principally through **Baptism**. This season links **Incarnation** and **Manifestation**.

### Baptism

**Christmas** as we know all too well can be trivialized. Each of us in this room, I believe, try in our own way to move beyond a sentimental appreciation of the innocence, tenderness, and vulnerability of an infant – to an appreciation and affirmation of the tremendous possibility and responsibility of being a grown up person – the one that infant is intended to be.

So also **Epiphany** has been kept tidy in a box for centuries as being the celebration of the 3 wisemen to the baby Jesus. It fills out the creché .

**Historically the feast may well have predated the celebration of Christmas by more than a century. Epiphany and Christmas together mark a most momentous truth for any Christian to proclaim.**

> Jesus was born a human being, humble as that is, and he became known, he was manifest to the world, as the **Messiah** and **Son of God**.

The season is marked above all by the account of Jesus’ **baptism** by John. The way had been prepared by the prophets – John being the latest example. And it was at that moment that God Himself announced to the world the relationship between Jesus and God.

> This is my beloved son!

And so it is that we can see Jesus’ baptism as the beginning of his ministry, the beginning of his living out who he truly was.

The church has always intended us to see our own lives as a reflection of Jesus’ life. The church has always intended us to live our lives into the fullness of what Christ did in the first place for us. The church has always called us to recognize that we are children of God through adoption by the power of the Holy Spirit in Jesus.

We are meant to see the meaning of our own lives through the lens of Jesus’ baptism. Our own lives are given meaning as we recognize more and more an identification with Jesus’ baptism.

The beginnings of my own journey as an adult Christian is wrapped up with trying to make sense out of **baptism.** That is because it is caught up in the birth and (shortly after that) the baptism of my first born child.


## My own journey into my baptism

I will present today a very quick overview of the growth of my understanding of baptism. I

I take this approach not because my faith journey is particularly important. But to illustrate that baptism for all of us is a lifelong journey. Perhaps we might call it a **pilgrimage**.

When I was a teenager I gave very little thought to baptism. My mother and my siblings all went to church every Sunday. I don’t think however that I saw very many baptisms because in those days baptisms were done outside of the Sunday service. Baptism was a private affair and indeed I think regarded primarily as a transaction between God and the infant. It was general practice in the Episcopal church that children were baptized not long after birth or at least when family could be gathered together.

I’m pretty sure that no one set out to instruct me about what baptism was all about so what I knew and thought about it I picked up from general information, and particularly what was stressed at the time of my own confirmation.

Somewhere I absorbed the notion that baptism was something that repaired original sin and thus assured that the infant was eligible for heaven. It was somehow about heaven and hell – but I didn’t have a clue about what I really believed or understood about those concepts.

### 1st Child

I mostly planned the baptism because of expectations that I placed on myself and that were probably projected onto me by the community around me.

I was by then on my way to seminary. The stakes for doing what was expected of you were increasing for me. There was an increasing need to understand. Probably it’s fair to say that my actually understanding was decreasing – headed for not understanding. As I studied and read, more and more deeply, listened to more and more theologians, I found that I understood baptism less and less but it seemed more and more important. Now, in the twilight of my career, I think understanding of the sacraments is really of only a minor concern. What is most important for me now, is trusting more and more completely on the unfathomable depth of Grace that God extends to us.

I learned at this time that there was an expectation that Easter was the very best time for baptisms. My first born was born just after Easter so we went with the 2nd best – Pentecost.

He was baptized with sprinkles of water from a font – as we will here today. All the rest of my children were baptized with lots of water.

## 2nd Child

Later when my 2nd child came along, at the age of 2 weeks he needed abdominal surgery. Largely because of that his baptized was delayed until – yep, Pentecost.

My major fear at that time was of Julian dying. It wasn’t a concern with the afterlife. It was the life right in front of me.

Our seminary community had just experienced a traumatic death of a 2 year old. It involved a malfunctioning Ford transmission and our experience made national news. I had long conversations with mentors and peers about the role of baptism under those circumstances and they convinced me that the sacrament was very much an act of the community. Kind of a way for the Christian community to say, "She is one of us!"

Somewhere over the next few years I began to shift my experience and my understanding of what baptism was all about. I was moving from thinking of baptism along with a fear of death – experiencing baptism as a celebration of life. A radical development in my experience and understanding of baptism.

### 3rd Child

At the baptism of my 3rd child I tried to put each of those understandings of baptism into practice. Particularly challenging for me was trying to get lots of water into a church that was not set up for it and not accustomed to doing things other than the way we had always done them.

I found a very large industrial bakers mixing bowl. I rested it on a stand I found and surrounded it by flowers. Miriam was submerged in the water and all went as planned. I saw the determination of tradition however in the response of the rector – my boss. He said it had looked like we were cooking Miriam in a wok.

The point was … that a large quantity of water was important. I came to appreciate that more and more as I became more and more convinced that baptism – as the other sacraments – was first and foremost a sacred symbol.

Sacred symbols warrant a lot more explanation. Sacred symbols are those things that effect what they signify. In more natural English: a sacred symbol brings about the very thing that it symbolizes and points toward.

The abundance of water that I came to want for the sacred symbol of baptism points to the abundance of God‘s love for his people. The sacrament causes that very thing to happen. Baptism is not a quiet gentle indicator of a grace we cannot see. It is the instrument by which untold millions before us – as well as an unknown number who will come after – live into an awareness and experience of life-giving grace. Amazing Grace.

At a later baptism I officiated at in Honolulu, we were in a garden area, standing in a large pool of water, having come from the Easter vigil, and the heavens themselves opened up as we stood in the pool of water. There is a photograph of my, the young man being baptized and the acolyte – one of my daughters – standing in the water being soaked by rain.

That is the way God’s grace works.

### not an end but the beginning of a journey
Bump into baptism

[Image of retreat center east of Chicago and small church ministry] … having coffee with the designer of the chapel and the font.

The font was so refreshing with water running down a little rivulet into a small pool. You could easily put your hand down into the water – make the sign of the cross.

The architect told me he wanted people to bump into their baptism the moment they entered his chapel.

I immediately latched onto that phrase and thought “How perfect.”

I first bumped into my baptism with Owen’s baptism (my first child), then subsequently at the baptism of Julian, then their sister Miriam, etc.

Once my life reaches its end, my hope is that I will have not just bumped into my baptism but I will have lived into the fullness of it.

### Jesus baptism marks the beginning of his ministry

Jesus’ baptism by John is at the beginning of all the gospels. The gospels are not reporting to us biographical data about Jesus. They are preaching to us the good news of God’s work in the life of God’s people.

They are good news for people who need good news.

They are not biographies, they are proclamations, intended to create followers of the Risen Lord – otherwise known in later years as Christians

They all place this baptism at the beginning of the Good News

As a great bible story-teller once put it, while telling the story of the whole Bible – “The Bible begins like all good stories begin, with ‘Once upon a time…’”

So with the Gospels and their Good News, they begin the way the gospel has to begin – with Jesus’ baptism by John The evidence from the gospels demonstrates that the early church Gospel story-tellers were in fact scandalized by this part of the story, the part about Jesus being baptized by John at the beginning of his ministry.

Imagine: at the very beginning, from the very beginning, the Gospel has caused a scandal.

We might suspect, then, that where the gospel no longer scandalizes, it may have lost its connection to its origins.

The scandal in the case of the baptism is that Jesus – whom John himself said he had come to prepare the way for – he was but a servant to the one who was to come after – that it was John who baptized Jesus. The lesser, as it were, baptizing the greater.

I tell you this …
I tell you these stories in order to make this point about baptism . Baptism is about a journey, the journey of living the life of a Christian.

Baptism is about growing into a deeper understanding, day by day, year-by-year as to what it means to be the body of Christ in the world of the living.

## Story (westerhoff) bury the child, raise up "Christian"

We choose to give him the best armor that we know for the living of the life he has before him. He will need all of what Christ can give him. And so today we call him Christian…

Frederich Buechner wrote: A crazy, holy grace I have called it. Crazy because whoever could have predicted it? Who can ever foresee the crazy how and when and where of a grace that wells up out of the lostness and pain of the world and of our own inner worlds?1

Baptism is a guide to becoming an adult and it is the measure of our life long journey. Baptism is a pilgrimage in which we fall many times, but Grace lifts us back up.

Baptism makes one a part of the Body of Christ, irrevocably, whether we acknowledge it or not, whether we ignore it for years at a time, Abba is with us.

Baptism provides the assurance that we are justified in putting our trust into the hands of the only one worthy of it – Abba

**Prayer of Abandonment**

Father, I put myself in your hands;
Father I abandon myself to you,
I entrust myself to you.
Father do with me as it pleases you.
Whatever you do with me, I will thank you for it.
Giving thanks for anything, I am ready for anything,
I accept anything, give thanks for anything.


— Blessed Charles de Foucauld

### Come to the edge

We are made in Christ to fly not walk about.Living into our baptism, like Jesus living into his, means living heroic lives. The calling requires extraordinary lives of blessing, forgiveness, service, prayer.

“Come to the edge,“ he said.
”We can’t, we’re afraid!“ they responded.
”Come to the edge,“ he said.
”We can’t, We will fall!“ they responded.
”Come to the edge," he said.
And so they came.
And he pushed them.
And they flew.”

― Guillaume Apollinaire
