## Opening

We have entered into another season of lent. For many of us it is not the first time. We have followed this cycle year-by-year through the patterns of our lives. If we let them we could trace the outline of the narrative of our lives as we have lived and moved into and away from our call to **life in Christ**.

It's not linear. It's not a straight line or even multiple ones. It's a circle. It's a cycle. That goes round and round. It is sacred.

My life has been marked by the attempt to preach on these lessons year-by-year, Lent by Lent. It is perhaps than my task of preaching that leads me to look at the big picture. Lent is a circle that comes around each year. Circle within a circle.

## sacred time is circular

One of the things that I have found important, mostly since teaching young people about religion, is that Church Time is circular. It's not linear. We travel from Advent to Advent and begin the cycle all over again. 
  
  Most of you are aware that the lessons we follow on Sundays focuses on one of the 3 synoptic gospels each cycle. Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The gospel of John is interspersed throughout the 3 years. 
  
  In addition to the annual cycle there are smaller cycles within the year. The Epiphany cycle is like a small snapshot of Jesus' ministry, beginning with his baptism. It may be important that our own ministries within the church begin with our baptism. The Epiphany cycle looks at Jesus' call to ministry, his call of disciples, and culminates in a dramatic scene with 3 of his closest disciples on the mount of Transfiguration.
  
  Transfiguration is the point at which the 3 synoptic gospels pivot and focus on Jesus final journey to his Passion and Resurrection. Culminating in the Resurrection. That's the cycle we're in now. The cycle of Lent. 
  
  I imagine for myself multiple gyres, rotating at different rates and different directions. 1.  A circular or spiral motion or form, especially a circular ocean current. Like the Olympic logo only with different size circles. Or a map of the ocean currents around the world, circling between Asia and North America, New Zealand and South America, North Atlantic, Africa and South America, Australia and Pacific Islands, and Antarctica.

  The Easter gyre, lasting 50 days until Pentecost, explores the meaning and implications of the Resurrection, for the disciples and followers of Jesus in the New Testament, and in the lives of Jesus' followers today – you and me.
  
  Finally there is the gyre of all the weeks from Pentecost until the next Advent. During this season the fullness of life in Christ is explored, with multiple themes and multiple emphases, as the whole task of following Jesus was a cycle within a cycle with a cycle. 
  
  My own experience is that being a disciple of Jesus is not like a once-off experience. The whole notion of experiencing conversion, and you're somehow all the way to home base, is a skewed way of thinking of **life in Christ**. 
  
  My own experience suggests that each day I enter a new set of challenges to being a disciple of Christ. Each day a cycle within a cycle. 
  
  Abram faced such new reality in the passage from Genesis we heard today. He was 99 years old and the LORD showed up at his doorstep and announced a covenant with him. His life changed with new requirements and – as a sign of the changed life – a new name.
  
  The power of meeting these texts over and over again, at different moments in our life, with different circumstances, has to do with the day by day task we each of us face to make our lives conform with that of Jesus himself. 
  
  So in Lent, the gyre we are following, is aimed squarely at the Passion of the Lord and the 3rd day reversal of the Resurrection. Lent, the cycle, pursues round and round, the implications of following Jesus to the cross. We hear Jesus tell us that directly in today's reading:
  
  > If any want to become my followers, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For those who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake, and for the sake of the gospel, will save it.
  
  Peter voices our initial resistance to doing such a thing. 
  
  > Jesus began to teach his disciples that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
  
  > But Peter says, "No. Please. No." 
  
  What he recognizes, of course, is that there will be **suffering** along the way.

## Suffering
  
  Suffering there is bound to be for Peter and the disciples. Bound to be because suffering is pretty much a universal experience. Actually, I think it is universal. Everyone suffers. That was the beginning of Gautama Buddha's experience and it is the lynch-pin of the Buddhist way. When I would ask my religion classes full of 18 year olds, "Is it true that we all have had the experience of suffering?" I often get a kind of blank look from some of them, while others readily nodded their head, "Yes." I think the hesitation was probably because they had never really reflected on it. When I look out at you I don't doubt that you all know what I'm saying about suffering. 
  
  > Jesus began to teach his disciples that the Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.
  
  Jesus suffered (that's what the word "Passion", Latin *patior*,  means in this context). And he invites us to "take up our cross to follow him." That's a part of what the invitation to keep a **holy Lent** is about, to focus our lives on the task at hand. To enter into the way of the passion of Jesus.
  
  But suffering is not an attractive thing. It's not an inviting thing. Typically we want to avoid it. Look at Peter's response. What do we do with this invitation? 
  
  Does Jesus' suffering make it all ok for the rest of us? Does Jesus' suffering offer a kind of redemption to each of us in our own suffering? Where is the redeeming value of suffering – for us? For Jesus? We know how Jesus's story ends. 

  One of the things I love about great stories like the Easter story. We know how it ends. We know the story. But we want to hear it again and again. Like the gyre that goes round and round. Sacred time.

## Atonement / Redemption
  
  [[atonement]] One of the things that has stayed with me from classes on theology from long ago is the lesson that the **Atonement** is the one essential Christian doctrine that has never been **defined** by the wider church. There are various theories about how our redemption  was effected in Jesus's death and Resurrection. Some denominations and local churches how to find one theory over another as being essential. But the wider church has not done that.

  There are several theories that have stood the test of time. One of them looked to the teaching of Jesus as well as with his actions such as the death, suffering and resurrection. It simply taught that Jesus came and died in order to bring about a positive change to humanity.

  Perhaps the most widely held theory holds that Jesus dies in order to defeat the powers of evil (such as sin, death, and the devil) in order to free mankind from their bondage.

  Especially prominent where the reformation is dominant are variations of a theory that holds that God pays a price for the sins of humankind. God pays as satisfaction, as substitution, or restitution to make things right.

  There are other theories as well, and many books could be written about all of them.

Perhaps here we are on safe ground to say that our salvation and redemption came through the suffering, death and resurrection of Jesus in ways beyond our knowing. Nevertheless as disciples of Jesus we are called to follow him in his way. 

## The final gyre is not the end but our beginning

ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω μία καὶ ὡυτή. [^1] The way up and the way down are one and the same, said a Greek philosopher 500 years before Christ. 

Words move, music moves\
Only in time; but that which is only living\
Can only die. Words, after speech, reach\
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,\
Can words or music reach\
The stillness, as a Chinese jar still\
Moves perpetually in its stillness.\
Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,\
Not that only, but the co-existence,\
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,\
And the end and the beginning were always there\
Before the beginning and after the end.

as one of my favorite 20th century poets says. [^2]

We have entered into this Lent. We know how the story ends. We've been here before. We will make our efforts to embrace the way of the cross. We will fail. We will meet the Risen Lord in glory. It will fade. Because the sacred story goes on and on by going round and round. We have entered the sacred story. It's done. There's no undoing it. And in the end, as that poet and the mystic before him put it, "All shall be well. All manner of thing shall be well."
