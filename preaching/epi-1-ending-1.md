### I tell you this …

I tell you these stories in order to make this point about baptism . Baptism is about a journey, the journey of living the life of a Christian.

Baptism is about growing into a deeper understanding, day by day, year-by-year as to what it means to be the body of Christ in the world of the living.

I tell you the stories to illustrate that all of you have similar stories of how you have grown more fully into the stature of Jesus Christ as you have lived your life. Jameson will do no less.

I tell you the stories because – if I had a lot more time --I would make it clear that I have fallen short over and over again from the goal that baptism sets before us. But I live by grace. The grace that lifts up the brokenhearted. The grace that mends the wounded. The grace that makes life worth living.

That is a little something of why we baptize Jameson today. We choose to give him the best armor that we know for the living of the life he has before him. He will need all of what Christ can give him. And so today we call him Christian…

Baptism is a guide to becoming an adult and it is the measure of our life long journey. Baptism is a pilgrimage in which we fall many times, but Grace lifts us back up.

Baptism makes one a part of the **Body of Christ**, irrevocably, whether we acknowledge it or not, whether we ignore it for years at a time, Abba is with us.

Baptism provides the assurance that we are justified in putting our trust into the hands of the only one worthy of it – **Abba**

### Grace

Father, I put myself in your hands;  
Father I abandon myself to you,  
I entrust myself to you.  
Father do with me as it pleases you.  
Whatever you do with me, I will thank you for it.  
Giving thanks for anything, I am ready for anything,  
I accept anything, give thanks for anything.

_Prayer of Abandonment_ of Blessed Charles de Foucauld
