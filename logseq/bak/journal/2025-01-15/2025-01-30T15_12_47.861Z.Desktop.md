## Pre-session worksheet (discernment)

Place in God's presence. Karen was taken aback when I asked her where God was in her move.

### life-changing event: Sit with God and let God help you to recall this experience.

- Moving to Hawai'i. If this is who the pull out for Sunday best … A household, huge house, books galore, all in a month. It became where I am from.
- interestingly there was a counter experience in the move back to the mainland
-

### Circumstances. What was God's presence like in the experience.

- Though it seemed to be utterly overwhelming, the going forward was smooth, one step at a time.

### What were some feelings, thoughts, and desires

- anxiety => shalom. Like electricity or vibrations of music. Fear => excitement, anticipation

### What differences did you notice with yourself? Change in your life?

- a new home. Deep peace culminating in "home" n.b. that for Karen it was "I was really me."

### anything new happening in you now as you remember and relive the experience?

The equally challenging piece was returning to the mainland. Where is God? is the over-riding question with no clear answers.
