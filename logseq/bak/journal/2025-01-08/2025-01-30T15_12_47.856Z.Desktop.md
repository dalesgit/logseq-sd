## Rabbit hole
Trying out Tiddlywiki again. I remember how I thought that it was working similar to the way I think. I have sermons.wiki at tiddlyhost.
The problems I remember were:

1. issues with saving
2. using markdown markup
3. exporting to usable files
- read somewhere that it natively exports to html and pandoc can move that to md.
- ## today's agenda:
- [ ] notes for tomorrow's module 2
- [ ] writing / working on sermon(s) for Sat/Sun  -- [[/pages/preaching.md]]
