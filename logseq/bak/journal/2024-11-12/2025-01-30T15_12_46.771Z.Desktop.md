	- [Trump selects Elon Musk to lead government efficiency department | Donald Trump | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-appoints-elon-musk-government-efficiency-department)
	  collapsed:: true
		- Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/vivek-ramaswamy) will lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, Donald Trump said on Tuesday.
		- Despite the name, the department will not be a government agency. Trump said in a statement that Musk and Ramaswamy will work from outside the government to offer the White House “advice and guidance” and will partner with the Office of Management and Budget to “drive large scale structural reform, and create an entrepreneurial approach to government never seen before.” He added that the move would shock government systems.
		- Trump said the duo “will pave the way for my administration to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies”.
		- It is not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.
		- Federal employees are generally required to disclose their assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.
		- Musk had pushed for a government efficiency department and has since relentlessly promoted it, emphasizing the acronym for the agency: Doge, a reference to a meme of an expressive Shiba Inu and the name of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, which Musk promotes. Trump said the agency will be conducting a “complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government, and making recommendations for drastic reforms”.
		- Trump said their work would conclude by 4 July 2026, adding that a smaller and more efficient government would be a “gift” to the country on the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.
		- Ramaswamy, meanwhile, is a wealthy biotech entrepreneur whose first time running for office was for the Republican party nomination last year. After dropping out of the race, he threw his support behind Trump. He told ABC earlier this week that he was having “high-impact discussions” about possible roles in Trump’s cabinet.
		- He also has no government experience, but has pushed for cost-cutting in the corporate sector. After building a stake in the struggling online media firm Buzzfeed, he [urged the company](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/28/vivek-ramaswamy-buzzfeed-staff-cuts-conservative-hires) in May to cut staff and hire conservative commentators like Tucker Carlson.
		- Musk, speaking to reporters last month, stated a goal of reducing government spending by $2tn. Practically speaking, experts say those cost cuts could result in deregulation and policy changes that would directly impact Musk’s universe of companies, particularly Tesla, SpaceX, X and Neuralink.
		- Trump had made clear that Musk would likely not hold any kind of full-time position, given his other commitments.
		- “I don’t think I can get him full-time because he’s a little bit busy sending rockets up and all the things he does,” Trump said at a rally in Michigan in September. “He said the waste in this country is crazy. And we’re going to get [Elon Musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk) to be our cost-cutter.”

	- This year has been “a masterclass in human destruction”, the UN secretary general has said as he reflected on extreme weather and record temperatures around the world fuelled by climate breakdown.
	- António Guterres painted a stark portrait of the consequences of climate breakdown that had arisen in recent months. “Families running for their lives before the next hurricane strikes; workers and pilgrims collapsing in insufferable heat; floods tearing through communities and tearing down infrastructure; children going to bed hungry as droughts ravage crops,” he said. “All these disasters, and more, are being supercharged by human-made climate change.”
	- Guterres was addressing scores of world leaders and high-ranking government officials from nearly 200 countries gathered in Azerbaijan for the [Cop29](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop29) UN climate summit. Over a fortnight of talks, nations will try to find ways to raise the vast sums of money needed to tackle the climate crisis.
	- Developing countries want guarantees of [$1tn a year](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/developing-world-needs-private-finance-for-green-transition-says-cop-president) in funds by 2035 to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather.
	- The talks have been [overshadowed by the re-election of Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-baku-climate-talks-odour-of-oil-return-of-trump-finance), an avowed climate denier, to the US presidency. Although leaders including the UK’s Keir Starmer, Barbados’s Mia Mottley and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan addressed the summit, the heads of government of most of the world’s biggest economies stayed away.
	- Starmer confirmed stringent new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as [revealed by the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/keir-starmer-to-unveil-ambitious-new-uk-climate-goal-cop29-ndc), which were praised by campaigners and experts. The UK is one of the first leading economies to present such a plan, months ahead of a UN deadline of next February.
	- The cut, of 81% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, will be partly met by decarbonising the electricity sector, but the government is also likely to have to add new policies to encourage public transport and walking, and a switch from gas heating to electric heat pumps.
	- Starmer told journalists at Cop29 that this [need not involve drastic changes](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2024/nov/12/world-leaders-to-speak-as-cop29-resumes-live-updates) to people’s lifestyles, , saying: “The race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow. I don’t want to be in the middle of the pack, I want to get ahead of the game.”
	- He told reporters: “At this Cop I was pleased to announce that we are building on our reputation as a climate leader with the UK’s 2035 NDC target to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% on 1990 levels.”
	- Rebecca Newsom, a senior policy adviser at Greenpeace International, said: “Starmer’s commitment to a relatively ambitious new target for cutting emissions will inject new momentum into the talks and he is right to highlight the huge opportunity offered by the green transition to cut bills, unlock investment and create jobs across the UK. But much clearer plans are still needed – particularly more investment for those working in offshore oil and gas to transition to renewable energy.”
	- We can hit UK’s carbon target without telling people how to live their lives, says Starmer – video
	- Governments were told at Cop they must take concerted action on reducing greenhouse gases or face economic disaster that could threaten them electorally.
	- Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate official, said politics, economics and the climate were now fatally entwined. Governments may be feeling the consequences of the worst inflation for decades but far more serious consequences were in store.
	- “Worsening climate impacts will put inflation on steroids,” Stiell said, tuning in to some of the economic fears that have helped deliver a series of electoral victories to rightwing parties around the world in the past year.
	- “The climate crisis is a cost-of-living crisis, because climate disasters are driving up costs for households and businesses. Climate finance is global inflation insurance.”
	- Rather than being an issue of protecting future generations, tackling greenhouse gas emissions was the only way to save the global economy in the short as well as the long term, Stiell said. “There has been a seismic shift in the global climate crisis. Because the climate crisis is fast becoming an economy killer – right now, today, in this political cycle,” he said.

	- Ilham Aliyev, the president of the Cop’s host nation, Azerbaijan, struck a different note. Azerbaijan has been a sizeable producer of oil and gas since the mid-19th century. Fossil fuels make up 90% of the country’s export income, and the infrastructure of oil and gas extraction is everywhere in evidence around the capital, Baku: a flaring refinery lights up the city’s night-time skyline, oil wells dot the suburbs, and tankers lumber across the Caspian Sea to its port. Even the country’s national symbol is a flame.
	- Aliyev, whose family is thought to have made billions from the country’s natural assets, called Azerbaijan’s oil and gas “a gift from God” and made clear the extraction would continue.
	- “As president of Cop29, of course we will be a strong advocate for green transition, and we are doing it,” he told the event. “But at the same time, we must be realistic.”
	- He attacked critics of the country – an autocratic state that has been found in NGO assessments to be one of the world’s most corrupt – and defended its use of its resources. “Countries should not be blamed [for having oil and gas deposits] and should not be blamed for bringing these resources to the market, because the market needs them. The people need them,” he said.
	- His words contrasted with pleas from dozens of developing country leaders for urgent action to stem the rising tide of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and rescue them from the consequences.
	- Hilda Heine, the president of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a tiny, low-lying atoll group in the Pacific that is threatened with inundation if temperatures rise much higher, criticised rich countries for telling the poor they must cut greenhouse gas emissions while failing to provide access to the finance that would enable that.
	- “It is in our blood to know when a tide is turning,” she said. “And on climate, the tide is turning today.”
	- On Monday the talks had got off to a slow start when officials tried to clear up some technical issues before the leaders arrived on Tuesday. A resolution on the trade of carbon offsets was passed, to the relief of the hosts, but this was criticised by some civil society groups [who said it was flawed and had been rushed through](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/critics-say-approval-of-climate-credits-rules-on-day-one-of-cop29-was-rushed).
	- The talks will continue on Wednesday when more world leaders including Giorgia Meloni of Italy and Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan will give addresses.

	- Last week, Donald Trump was [elected president](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/how-trump-won-us-election-president) for a second time. The convicted felon, who has been accused of [sexual misconduct](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein) by more than [two dozen women](https://www.axios.com/2024/10/28/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-women), has been open about his plans to take “[revenge](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/30/trump-threats-election-enemy-within)” against his political opponents, pursue [mass deportations](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/oct/31/election-trump-immigration-policies) of immigrants, [rescind](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/24/donald-trump-presidency-republican-lawmakers-targeting-lgbtq-policies) federal LGBTQ+ non-discrimination policies and roll back [climate protections](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/sep/06/presidential-election-climate-crisis-project-2025-trump).
	- Many Americans have been worrying about what a second Trump term would mean for their lives, communities and futures. We spoke to activists and therapists across the country about how they were dealing with the news and how they planned to take action going forward.
	- “I have to remind myself that our pursuit of justice, of equity, is a marathon, not a sprint,” said Faisal Al-Juburi, chief external affairs officer of Raices, a group that offers support and legal representation to immigrants.

	- I am feeling heartbreak and frustration. Anti-immigrant sentiment was pervasive throughout this election cycle – racial politicking and the promise of harm to immigrant families were central to President Trump’s campaign. So his re-election reflects a sobering reality that the scapegoating of Black and brown people sadly resonated with the public.
	- Remember that you have the agency to rebuff today’s cries for resilience. Unyielding strength is something our society demands only of those whose rights we systematically obstruct. So grant yourself the grace and luxury to feel that you’re not going to be okay – but know that you will be. Take the time to grieve, to replenish your body, mind and soul. Then rise up and heed the call to fight for justice once more.

	- I’m feeling a lot of things: anger, fear, exhaustion. Basically what our callers are also feeling. We’re not a political organization, but we know that the election is going to directly affect us. So it’s frightening.
	- We’re checking in with each other just to see how we’re doing. What I’m doing with volunteers is asking them, “Do you have support in your life? Other friends, or people you could talk to?” All of this is so fresh. We’re still processing it.
	- Unfortunately the LGBT community has always faced darkness and people pushing against us. So what we always need to do is circle back – check in on yourself and check in on those you love. And be aware of your own limitations. If you need to take a break, take a break. Are you doomscrolling right now? If that’s making you feel worse, take a step back.
	- Don’t burn out. Maybe shut your brain off. You’re allowed to do that. My brain-shutting-off thing is doing dishes. I didn’t do any of my dishes last night knowing that I would need them today.
	- ## Tamika Lewis, clinical director and founder of [WOC Therapy](https://woctherapy.com/)
	- I feel rattled for sure. I’m trying to allow myself time to be with the emotions. I think that oftentimes, our default as women of color is to get distracted or get busy and to try to power our way through hard emotions.
	- [On the day after the election] I canceled a couple of things and rested. I’m trying to manage how much news I take in. But after I get over the hump of this shock, I do feel an urgency around mobilizing. Maybe that’s shifting our services to more group models so that we can reach more people. I think there’s going to be higher rates of anxiety and distress, and we’re going to need more access to mental health, especially in marginalized communities.
	- I want to stay hopeful for society. Especially for our teens, because they feel so much existential despair. I still want to choose hope. We just got a new puppy, and nothing is as soothing as a puppy. She brings so much light and play to an otherwise really dark moment. I think we need to practice that too.
	- ## Nancy Lumb, LCSW, New York City
	- Licensed clinical social workers take an oath when we get our degrees, and it’s about values of service and social justice and the worth of the person. Basically, the importance of human relationships, integrity and competence. All of those things seemed to be questioned during this election.
	- As therapists, we need to walk the walk that we teach people. That means using coping skills like breathing, mindfulness and meditation to remain in the present so that we’re responsive versus reactive. If we let ourselves spin out, what are the next four years going to look like?
	- When I think about what I’m going to do going forward, I think about what I can control and what I can’t. What are the positive things I can do to affect me and others in a positive way? Then I can put energy into that.
	- ## Madison Nardy, director of [215 People’s Alliance](https://215pa.org/)
	- I am coping with my emotions by allowing myself time to feel and process them, while simultaneously putting my emotions into actions. This helps prevent my feelings from becoming overwhelming or paralyzing. For me, it is a way to align my values with meaningful impact and to feel connected to the larger purpose of collective liberation. It also helps keep my emotions balanced and grounded.

	- To keep ourselves grounded, we need to resist the urge to internalize the weight of these policies as personal failures. It’s crucial to remain focused on the long view: our collective history of resistance, our shared capacity for resilience and our ability to create change despite being systematically undermined. It’s easy to feel crushed by the overwhelming nature of these issues, but by focusing on tangible actions – like organizing, building solidarity and directly supporting our communities – we remind ourselves that we’re not passive victims of these systems. We are active participants in shaping a different future, even when it feels like the system is stacked against us.
	- ## Melody Li, LMFT, founder of [Inclusive Therapists](https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/)
	- I feel deep compassion and care for oppressed and marginalized communities that are navigating a spectrum of emotions such as grief, disgust, fear and anger. I am also feeling centered, emboldened and motivated to mobilize. Cycles of structural violence are nothing new here on stolen land built upon by stolen lives. Indigenous and Black communities especially have resisted, fought back and created amazing systems of care for generations.
	- Your fear and overwhelm are real and valid. Be gentle with yourself. Surround yourself with chosen family and kin that honor your feelings and experiences. Create soft spaces for you and your community to grieve and tend to your hearts. Self- and community-care are both important – remember to water and nourish yourself and one another. Don’t be afraid to ask for help and support – we will move through this together.

	- I have been really trying to ground myself in my routines. I think that’s something that’s helpful to anyone, regardless of your work or your position. Having a sense of normalcy and doing the things you typically do – making a meal, cuddling your pet. It’s a reminder of the safety you can feel in your home and your relationships. I had a good cry, then made a smoothie.
	- Be mindful about how you talk to yourself and others, and don’t force toxic positivity. Sometimes, there isn’t a silver lining. For many of us, this isn’t surprising. This isn’t the first time we’ve been confronted with a sense of a lack of safety, or have felt the effects of hatred. When we try to soothe ourselves or other people prematurely and say: “Well, not much about your life will change” – that’s not helpful. It can feel like gaslighting. Sometimes, it’s just shit, and that’s what this is. We can sit with that, hold that, and then turn to mobilizing and activism.
	- ## Ariela Lara, student at UC Berkeley and organizer with the [Sunrise Movement](https://www.sunrisemovement.org/)
	- I’m feeling scared and overwhelmed. As a woman of color and daughter of an immigrant mother I fear how Trump’s agenda will strip our rights away – whether it’s mass deportations that will reach our communities, my reproductive rights, or the climate policies I’ve organized toward for most of my teen years.
	- What kept me sane through this election process? Talking to voters, knocking on doors, understanding where people are coming from when their government hasn’t been working for them. I’m taking action by organizing a walkout at UC Berkeley.
	- With all the emotions that are weighing on me, I will create the disruption needed to win bold policies, protect our voices and rights. I am relying on my community, because we are going to need each other now more than ever. Mutual aid groups, checking in on my family, friends and mobilizing collectively gives me hope. Moving forward I will continue fighting for my neighbors, the people I see on the bus ride home and the students I go to class with.

	- Getting outside, moving my body and doing breathwork are always top of my list for coping with difficult stuff. Connection with others is also very helpful. Going forward, I suspect finding opportunities to take action on specific issues I care about will be helpful.
	- We learned a few things from the 2016 election. Nothing unfolded exactly the way we thought it would. That’s not to say bad things didn’t happen, because of course they did. But anxiety was not right about everything. Anxiety is very good at convincing us that we know exactly what’s going to happen, that the way we feel right now is the way we will always feel and that we won’t be able to cope. But the fact that those things feel true right now doesn’t mean they are true.
	- Activists are a stubborn bunch of people. They’re in it for the long haul, and they are used to the rollercoaster of progress and loss. No one is giving up.

	- A friend recently asked: “Do you think the United States will survive the anger of white men?” As blunt as the question is, the core element is not so far-fetched. In fact, the [majority of white men](https://www.nbcwashington.com/decision-2024/2024-voter-turnout-election-demographics-trump-harris/3762138/) (and [women](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/granderson-theres-no-mystery-white-women-handed-trump-the-election/ar-AA1tFTmN?ocid=BingNewsSerp)) who voted in the presidential election in 2024 have rallied around a man who has called for the “[termination of the constitution](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/03/politics/trump-constitution-truth-social/index.html)”, vowed to be a “[dictator](https://apnews.com/article/trump-hannity-dictator-authoritarian-presidential-election-f27e7e9d7c13fabbe3ae7dd7f1235c72)”, and threatened to [deploy the US military](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/11/06/trump-won-heres-what-could-mean-military.html) against Americans.

	- The fact that Donald Trump’s candidacy was even viable, given that horrific track record, was because of the support of white men.

And, as the New York Times reported, the downwardly mobile, frustrated “white men [without a degree](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/26/upshot/census-relative-income.html), [who] have been surpassed in income by college-educated women”.
	- And let’s be clear. Trump has laid out an agenda that will provide the “[wages of whiteness](https://items.ssrc.org/reading-racial-conflict/beyond-the-wages-of-whiteness-du-bois-on-the-irrationality-of-antiblack-racism/#:~:text=In%20Black%20Reconstruction%20in%20America1%2C%20Du%20Bois%20famously,social%20status%20derived%20from%20their%20classification%20as%20%E2%80%9Cnot-black.%E2%80%9D)” to his male supporters but very little else.

	- This is nothing new. White male anger, especially at the nation’s inclusion of African Americans, has repeatedly privileged white supremacy over the viability of the United States. During the war of independence, when the nation was fighting to become the United States, South Carolina’s government fumed at Congress’s request to arm the enslaved and give them their freedom in exchange for fending off a British force that was more than 10 times the size of what those in Charleston could muster. Government officials flat out refused and barked that they weren’t sure that the US “was a nation worth fighting for” and would rather take their chances with the king of England. In short, enslaving those of African descent was infinitely more important than the United States.
	- Later on, during the subsequent battles over drafting the constitution, far too many white slaveholding men were willing to hold the United States hostage unless they got their way. That meant reinforcing slavery and the power of slaveholders, despite the document’s language about “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. They threatened. They raged. They schemed. And they succeeded.
	- The three-fifths clause, which partially counted each enslaved human being by that fraction, gave the slaveholding south disproportionate and unearned power in the US House of Representatives. The Fugitive Slave Clause allowed them to hunt down beyond their state borders those seeking that elusive freedom from bondage. The additional 20 years of the Atlantic Slave Trade meant they could secure more human cargo directly from Africa to engorge the coffers of those placing racialized slavery above democracy.
	- The disastrous contradictions embedded in the founding of the United States could not help but erupt into civil war. Once again, a group of white men [were angry](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states). Angry that the country [had elected a man](https://nerd.wwnorton.com/ebooks/epub/amerele3hs/EPUB/content/4.1.5-chapter13.xhtml) who did not want to see slavery spread beyond the South. Angry that Abraham Lincoln’s position meant a diminution of the south’s national political power. Angry that Lincoln was a Republican, a party founded on anti-slavery. So, in cold, calculated anger they attacked the United States of America. They set out to destroy it.
	- They did not succeed. But that war sowed the dragon’s teeth that [undermined the promise](https://books.google.com/books?id=W_yKDwAAQBAJ\&printsec=frontcover\&source=gbs_ge_summary_r\&cad=0#v=onepage\&q\&f=false) of a true multi-racial democracy and led to the horrors of Jim Crow. When the need for correcting the US’s decidedly unequal democracy ran headlong into the threat of nuclear annihilation during the cold war, the choice should have been obvious. But, once again, white men’s anger put the United States in jeopardy.
	- In 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik, a satellite, which proved that the USSR unexpectedly had the capabilities to launch its nuclear arsenal across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The US [was no longer safe](https://www.nytimes.com/1957/10/13/archives/us-missile-experts-shaken-by-sputnik-weight-of-satellite-called.html?searchResultPosition=1). President Dwight Eisenhower responded by proposing the National Defense Education Act, which would pump hundreds of millions of dollars into universities so the US would have the “[brainpower to fight](https://books.google.com/books?id=lTKQAAAAMAAJ\&q=Brainpower+to+fight+the+cold+war\&dq=Brainpower+to+fight+the+cold+war\&hl=en\&newbks=1\&newbks_redir=0\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwiClPSSocmJAxXqRTABHSyZAdoQ6AF6BAgFEAI) the cold war”.
	- The bill was shepherded through Congress by two Alabama legislators, the representative Carl Elliott and the senator J Lister Hill. Both wanted the money but neither wanted what came with it. In other words, they wanted to continue to deny admission to African Americans to their racially exclusive universities, such as Ole Miss, LSU, the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama. If this was about educating those who could give the US an edge in the cold war, then limiting that access by [race was folly](https://www.npr.org/2020/02/24/517784975/katherine-johnson-nasa-mathematician-and-an-inspiration-for-hidden-figures-dies).
	- Yet Elliott and Hill, both signatories to the virtually insurrectionist [Southern Manifesto](https://www.naacpldf.org/brown-vs-board/southern-manifesto-massive-resistance-brown/), which vowed to use every weapon at the congressional membership’s disposal to stop Brown v Board of Education from darkening their states’ doorsteps, refused to move the bill forward. They demanded, instead, that Eisenhower provide assurances that those hundreds of millions of dollars would be as whites-only as their universities. Faced with the dilemma of Jim Crow or possible nuclear annihilation, the angry white men chose to protect Jim Crow, not the United States.
	- Similarly, today, despite the warnings from [generals](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/30/us/politics/trump-administration-criticism.html) who served with Trump, [police officers](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/he-betrayed-us-officers-who-protected-the-capitol-grapple-with-trump-s-return/ar-AA1tDmp3?ocid=BingNewsSerp) who endured the attacks on January 6, and a God-fearing then [vice-president](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/15/politics/pence-will-not-endorse-trump/index.html) Mike Pence who was targeted for a [hanging](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/25/trump-expressed-support-hanging-pence-capitol-riot-jan-6-00035117) with gallows constructed during the insurrection, the angry white men who propped up Trump’s return to the White House ignored everything they say they valued – the military, law enforcement and God – to give into the rage of [white grievance](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-race-ethnicity-and-politics/article/who-buys-the-big-lie-white-racial-grievance-and-confidence-in-the-fairness-of-american-elections/4BB3B6F641B41D8B63D152F9779C64CE), the “[pastiche of sweaty anger](https://www.threads.net/@mediaite/post/DCAGpVJSg5t?xmt=AQGzR1jqZSb4RvMritzc7_vaD7yV6JX0zBYbVR7uJ_7ib32BXw)” that the Trump-Vance campaign peddled, and to the fear and violence embedded in the [“great replacement” theory](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-is-great-replacement-theory-and-how-does-it-fuel-racist-violence).
	- Once again, unfortunately, the anger about a multi-racial democracy has put the viability of the United States in jeopardy.
