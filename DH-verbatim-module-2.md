- ## February 7
- we opened with her saying that the anxiety had quieted down, even as the world around us has got absurdly worse.
- She said that her task ahead of her is now not so much understanding and figuring out inwardly who she is and what she should do. But is now more obviously a doing rather than knowing.
- - She reflected on the Indians being shipped in shackles and innocent people being held in Guantánamo and is horrified. She used to think that she would run away. But the places she would have gone have been compromised as in Ecuador, Canada, and England.
- I observed for her that she used the word illegal to refer to undocumented persons. I suggested that our use of language was one of the things that we can do. And that the little thing can have a broader impact.
- I suggested that since she has made progress in acceptance and asking this particular question about what to do, that I have found it helpful in the past to put things out in front of me what are the options? The writing out of what’s actually possible leads to clarification about who would be impacted and what feels like the right thing to do.
- She is aware of the impact that’s possible with the older 12-year-old who is a big man and they do talk and he is gentle and considerate. As well, the toddler can accept what she models for him.
- She recognized that that that does work and is a part of the process of discernment for her.
- In the end, she seemed most taken by the use of language. She acknowledged that her masters degree was in rhetoric.
-the bottom line it seems to me that she had made progress today in discerning what to do about the deteriorating world we live in.
- I gave several examples of the impact of language and example. Without naming names, I told of how Patty had been surprised when she realized that Mary Pat and I had kept her confidence, or rather Peter’s confidence.
- I told also about how I had a commitment to myself as a priest, to always speak what I believe to be true. I told her I distrusted, speaking platitudes, because of how other people project onto representatives of Christians reflecting God.
