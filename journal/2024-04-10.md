	- *A persontsgs without a soul friend is like a body without a head.
	  *—attributed to St. Brigid of Kildare
	- *Indeed we each need one special friend, who may be called a friend of the soul.  We must open our souls completely to this friend, hiding nothing and revealing everything.  And we must allow this friend to assess and judge what he sees.
	  *—Pelagius *
