- **22:42** [[american-culture]] : [Opinion | Jim McDermott left Congress. Then he had to leave the country. - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/02/27/jim-mcdermott-expat-france-trump/)
	- As a twice-divorced bachelor living on his own, he has bouts of loneliness. He misses his children and grandchildren. His French is lousy.
	- McDermott’s experience raises serious questions for Americans, especially those in positions of power. Is the United States facing a situation so dangerous that you would be foolish if you didn’t have a backup plan? Or is it hyperbole to imagine the country sliding into authoritarian rule that would unleash violence, retribution and repression?
	- His motivations for moving here are political: Universal health care. Respect for women’s reproductive rights, including abortion, the issue on which McDermott won his first election in 1970. Serious gun control.
