	- Justin Welby, 68, resigned on Tuesday, five days after the independent Makin Report singled him out for criticism over his handling of abuse allegations dating back to the 1970s.
	- Here is what you need to know:
	- ## Who is Justin Welby, and why did he resign?
	- Welby announced his resignation “in sorrow”, taking “personal and institutional responsibility” for a lack of action on the “heinous abuses” allegedly committed by the late John Smyth, a volunteer at Christian summer camps decades ago.
	- “The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,” Welby said.
	- Educated at Britain’s most prestigious private school, Eton, Welby worked in the oil industry for more than a decade before being ordained in 1992. He was made the senior prelate of the Church of England in 2013.

	- [Welby](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/12/justin-welby-resigns-as-archbishop-of-canterbury-over-abuse-scandal) was an outspoken spiritual leader of the global Anglican community who grappled publicly with issues ranging from same-sex marriage to Britain’s immigration policy, Israel’s war in Gaza, slavery reparations, climate change and his own mental health problems.

	- ## Who was John Smyth, and what was he accused of?
	- Smyth was an evangelical, Canadian-born, British barrister who held leadership roles in a charity called the Iwerne Trust, which ran Christian camps in England and Wales.
	- Initial details of Smyth’s physical abuse of schoolboys who had attended the camps during the 1970s and 1980s emerged in a 1982 report by the charity.
	- Smyth was reported to have brought pupils from prestigious public schools in England, including Winchester College, to his home, where he lashed them with a cane in his shed.
	- The case was not reported to the police by the trust, the church or the schools whose pupils were subjected to abuse.
	- Instead, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe, where he set up the Zambesi Ministries, which ran similar Christian camps for schoolboys.
	- In 1992 after facing charges of killing a teenage boy who was found dead in a swimming pool, Smyth moved to Cape Town, South Africa.
	- In 2013, a victim reported abuse by Smyth to the [Church of England](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/11/church-of-england-says-it-knew-of-slavery-links), which in turn reported the allegations to the police, but an investigation was not initiated.
	- The 1982 Iwerne Trust report was made public in 2016, prompting an investigation by Channel 4 News in 2017.
	- Smyth died the next year in Cape Town at the age of 77.
	- In total, he has been held responsible for the violent abuse of at least 115 children and young men in England, Zimbabwe and South Africa.
	- The report said Smyth had subjected boys and young men to “brutal and horrific” physical and sexual abuse over a 40-year period.
	- Smyth beat some victims with up to 800 strokes of a cane and supplied nappies to absorb the bleeding, the report said.
	- He would then drape himself over his victims, sometimes kissing them on the neck or back.
	- Welby said he had “no idea or suspicion” of the allegations before 2013, but the independent report concluded it was unlikely he would have had no knowledge of the concerns regarding Smyth in the 1980s.
	- ## Who could succeed Welby?
	- Under the church’s rules, the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) is a body of clerics that manages the choice of Welby’s successor.
	- It submits the name of a preferred and an alternative candidate to the United Kingdom’s prime minister, who then advises the monarch on the appointment.
	- It is too early to tell who the CNC will select as Welby’s successor, but there are some likely candidates.
	- Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and the second most senior bishop of the Church of England, will be in the running.
	- Cottrell released a statement after Welby’s resignation, saying it was “the right and honourable thing to do”.
	- A former chief nursing officer in the Department of Health and current bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, could also be in the running. She is the third most senior bishop in the Church of England.

	- The bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, has been vocal in calling for Welby to step down, which could make her a possible candidate as the Church of England looks to distance itself from the scandal.
	- She has also recently come out as saying she has experienced “coercive language” from Welby and Cottrell in the past.
	- Martyn Snow, the bishop of Leicester; Graham Usher, the bishop of Norwich; and Guli Francis-Dehqani, the bishop of Chelmsford, have all also been tipped to succeed Welby.
	- Snow abstained in a church assembly vote on blessings for gay couples while Usher is in favour of gay rights.
	- Francis-Dehqani was born in Iran and has spoken about how her brother was killed in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution.
	- If a woman is chosen archbishop of Canterbury, she would be the first to occupy the post.
	- ## Has the church faced other abuse allegations in the past?
	- Welby’s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England.
	- A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England “a place where abusers could hide”.

	- Boomers weren't born into the digital age, which means they grew up in a slower paced world. Boomers would never have believed that someday we'd all walk around with phones in our pockets, let alone phones that were also computers that could connect people in an instant.
	- Technological advances make certain aspects of life easier, but the drawbacks shouldn't be ignored either. Leaning into a boomer lifestyle and adopting some of their habits can be beneficial for everyone, no matter how old you are.
	- ## Here are 10 boomer habits people make fun of that are actually good for you
	- ### 1. Eating dinner at the table
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-dinner-at-table.png){:width 675 :height 380} Monkey Business Images | Shutterstock
	- Boomers might get dragged for eating dinner at 5:30 in the evening and not tipping their servers, yet it turns out that one part of their mealtime routine is actually very good for you: eating dinner at the table, without the distraction of screens.
	- Putting their phones away and eating at the table gives people built-in time to decompress and reconnect. [Intuitive eating counselor Lisa Newman explained](https://www.yourtango.com/family/signs-child-needs-family-dinners) that having a shared family meal leads to healthier eating patterns, along with less family stress and stronger bonds between family members.
	- She acknowledged that it can be super tempting for parents of younger children to pop their kids in front of a screen so they can eat a meal in relative peace and quiet, yet restricting screens around meals teaches kids many essential life skills, like mindful eating, proper manners, and how to have an actual conversation.
	- [Going screen-free for every meal](https://www.yourtango.com/self/parenting-coach-shares-3-step-method-getting-kids-off-screens) might not be possible, yet aiming for one night a week where phones disappear and everyone eats together at the table can be seriously beneficial for the whole family.

	- ### 2. Going to bed early
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-sleep-early.png){:width 675 :height 380} PeopleImages.com - Yuri A. | Shutterstock
	- Another boomer habit people make fun of that's actually good for you is going to bed early. Getting a good night's sleep is often easier said than done, yet as [one public health study](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/17/10740) from the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health revealed, a large portion of people's sleep disturbances have to do with technology.
	- The study noted that taking our phones to bed and being chronically online makes it harder to disconnect and turn our brains off to get the rest we desperately need. Americans today sleep less than 7.5 hours a night on average, which is a major decrease from the amount of sleep people used to get. In 1910, Americans slept for an estimated average of 9 hours a night.
	- Low-quality sleep [can negatively impact people's mental and physical health](https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/things-that-happen-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep), which means that making fun of boomers for tucking in early doesn't make much sense. If younger generations followed in their footsteps and went to bed earlier, it's highly likely they'd feel significantly better than they do now, doom-scrolling until dawn.
	- ### 3. Drinking coffee every morning
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-coffee.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
	- The older people get, the more tied to their routines they become, but in the case of morning coffee, that's a good thing. [Nutrition experts at Johns Hopkins University revealed](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you) that drinking coffee isn't as bad of a habit as people think it is, since coffee has antioxidants and other substances that reduce internal inflammation and protect people from disease. Coffee consumption might even put a stop to certain conditions that are more common for women, including heart disease and Alzheimer's disease.
	- The nutrition experts noted that drinking one to two cups of coffee a day can protect against heart failure and stroke. Drinking coffee can protect your liver and help your body process sugar better. Health benefits aside, [having a morning ritual](https://www.yourtango.com/self/morning-habits-give-you-unfair-advantage-rest-of-day) can keep people feeling balanced and ready to take on the day, which is something everyone needs more of.
	- ### 4. Calling instead of texting
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-phone-call.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
	- Boomers might get made fun of for their communication style, like sending an email, then sending a follow-up text to make sure you got their email, then using the phone in a way Steve Jobs never intended and calling, to tell you they sent you a text. Yet it turns out that calling instead of texting is actually good for you.
	- Despite how connected we are to the digital world, [we live in a lonelier era than ever before](https://www.yourtango.com/self/four-reasons-americans-lonelier-than-people-other-countries). The ease of sending a text cuts people off from each other. Texting might make communication seem more streamlined, but we miss out the joy of hearing our loved ones' voices on the other line.
	- In a conversation with YourTango CEO Andrea Miller on [YourTango's podcast, "Getting Open,"](https://youtu.be/vXMQtVC_QkI?si=bD7vQ0UxXje-JnDc) [psychologist Guy Winch revealed](https://www.yourtango.com/2023367409/it%E2%80%99s-time-swallow-our-pride-and-be-one-who-goes-first) why reaching out to other people is the only way to soothe loneliness.
	- "When you're lonely, you feel so alone, so raw, so rejected, so unseen, that the idea of reaching out and risking more rejection or a rebuff seems more than you can stand, so you don't," he explained. "You see on social media, everyone looks connected, happy, in groups, with friends, and you're sitting by yourself... and you feel like my emotional needs, my connection needs are not being met. And it's that gap that creates loneliness."
	- Winch described loneliness as an emotional wound, saying it's "something that needs healing. It needs proactivity on your part. Wounds, emotional ones, don't usually heal just by themselves that well. They need an assist, like any other wound."
	- He advocated for stepping up and doing the scariest thing imaginable: calling people first.
	- "You need to be brave, you need to start putting together the support as much as you can, and start advocating for yourself, and really start reaching out," he concluded.
	- ### 5. Going to the library
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-going-to-library.png){:width 675 :height 380} polinaloves | Shutterstock
	- It might seem super old-timey to sit quietly, surrounded by stacks of books, but libraries provide so much more than reading material. They're community spaces that offer free or low-cost classes and clubs. Going to the library is a way to stay connected, and the best part about it: it's free!
	- [Visiting the library is one habit](https://www.yourtango.com/self/gen-zers-and-millennials-have-adopted-unlikely-place-their-gathering-spot) that Gen Z and millennials have adopted as their own. They're walking down the road toward nostalgia and finding a wealth of access, along with that elusive "third space" outside of their homes and workplaces where they can go to find in-person communities.
	- **RELATED:** **10 Things Boomer Kids Did Growing Up That Would Make Gen Z Cry**
	- ### 6. Using coupons
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-coupons.png){:width 675 :height 380} PR Image Factory | Shutterstock
	- The idea of collecting coupons might conjure up the image of your grandma, sitting in her bathrobe on Sunday morning, cutting coupons out of the newspaper and storing them alphabetically in one of those little accordion-boxes. Coupons might not be fire, but in a world where groceries are more expensive than ever, using coupons just hits different.
	- Boomers are often criticized for their role in building their wealth in a way that's denied the generations after them that same access, yet their [frugal habits are something younger people can definitely learn from](https://www.yourtango.com/self/daily-habits-frugal-people-make-big-difference).
	- ### 7. Writing by hand
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-writing.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
	- A boomer habit people make fun of that is actually good for you is writing by hand. Typing might be faster than putting pen to paper, but we miss out on major cognitive processes when we don't write by hand. Writing by hand requires the different brain systems to work together.
	- For young kids, writing by hand builds a foundation for literacy later in life by improving memory and word recall. For adults, writing by hand helps people understand complex topics. Handwriting also forces us to slow down and pay attention to what we're putting on the page.
	- [As neuroscientist Ramesh Balasubramaniam explained](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/11/1250529661/handwriting-cursive-typing-schools-learning-brain), "There's actually some very important things going on during the embodied experience of writing by hand. It has important cognitive benefits." Writing by hand might seem more work, but it's actually really good for you, and for your brain.
	- ### 8. Fixing broken things instead of replacing them
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-fixing.png){:width 675 :height 380} BAZA Production | Shutterstock
	- Repairing broken things instead of replacing them is a solid way to save money and cut down on waste. Fixing things can also boost your sense of accomplishment since you're learning a new, hands-on skill.
	- Tinkering with a toaster oven might seem like a strange way to spend the weekend, but older appliances are often better built than their modern counterparts, which is an argument for not throwing them away.
	- Not all old-fashioned habits should be overlooked, especially [ones that help you live within your means](https://www.yourtango.com/self/old-fashioned-habits-bring-back-live-frugally). So, channel your inner boomer, strap on your tool belt and start fixing.

	- ### 9. Walking every day

	- Moving our bodies, even just a little every day, is essential for our physical and mental health. [According to the American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/defeating-depression-naturally), adults who got the recommended amount of weekly exercise, which breaks down to about 2.5 hours of walking, lowered their risk of depression by 25%.
	- [A study from Harvard Medical School](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510363) discovered that access to nature can actually lower a person's mortality rate. "The truth is, we are nature," [Peter James, a professor at Harvard Medical School, explained](https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/walk-woods-may-boost-mental-health). "We were not evolved to be in a windowless room staring at a computer screen. These artificial environments make us stressed. They force us to focus more than we want to, and they tire our cognitive function."
	- [Walking every day is a simple and effective way](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/reino-gevers/why-walking-good-for-you) to shake up your routine and put your health first.
	- ### 10. Sending thank you notes
	- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-thank-you-notes.png){:width 675 :height 380} BAZA Production | Shutterstock
	- In an age of email and instant communication, taking the time to write and send a note feels special. It's an act of care and kindness that shows how much you truly appreciate someone.
	- Sending thank you notes is an important part of practicing gratitude, and [it shows you were raised with good manners](https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-people-use-raised-good-manners). There's nothing quite like the joy of seeing an envelope addressed to you, amidst piles of junk mail.
	- While some boomer habits are better left in the past, other habits should be brought back, because they actually improve your quality of life.

	- *During the 1920 US presidential election, [Warren G Harding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/warren-g-harding/) campaigned with the slogan “[return to normalcy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/return-to-normalcy)” – a return to how things were before the first world war. This included deregulation and isolationism. He won with a decisive victory and in 1922 introduced the [Fordney-McCumber Tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff), a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods.*
	- ## America and Europe
	- From our New York correspondent
	  7 June 1922
	- Most internationally minded American observers who were at [Genoa](https://www.britannica.com/event/Conference-of-Genoa) or have been following recent events from Europe earnestly desire greater American participation in European affairs. Many thoughtful English liberals agree with them. But, curiously enough, many in America who share their hope that the United States may soon appreciate and bear her share of the world’s burdens and problems believe that participation by the American government in European conferences would at this time be futile and perhaps dangerous.
	- [Mr Hughes](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/hughes-charles-evans) is a man of principle, but Mr Harding is a man of expediency. There is no doubt that the administration would like to take a larger part in European affairs; there is no doubt that the financial interests, to which it lends an attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that financial interest to which it lends and attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that the mass of American sentiment is steadfastly against it. The huge majority by which Mr Harding defeated the Democratic candidate in the autumn of 1920 was in large part a reaction against Mr Wilson’s entanglement in transatlantic politics.
	- In so far as recent byelections and primary elections can be interpreted as bearing upon foreign policy they show a clear sympathy with the “irreconcilables” who kept the United States out of the League. The Administration, which shifts its domestic policy after every vote in an effort to please the country, would be even more incapable of a clearcut foreign policy.
	- On the Russian question of course the United States has a policy – as intransigent as that of France. Mr Hughes and Mr Hoover, the two strong men of the Cabinet.
	- **A prejudice analysed**
	  The popular prejudice against participation in European affairs is often misinterpreted in [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news). It is, in part, of course, merely content with the relative prosperity in America, a selfish unwillingness to bother about a sick continent so far away. But it is vastly more than that. The figures of private donations for relief in Northern France, in Germany, in Austria, in Russia – which mounted into the tens of millions last year and continue mounting – are one proof of that. To anyone in touch with the pulse of American life it is plain that the main reason for the hesitation to plunge into Europe is a kind of bewildered disappointment at the results of America’s last plunge. There is no confidence in America’s diplomatic wisdom. The ordinary American farmer has two strong convictions – first, that the Europeans are making a mess of things; and, second, that the Americans, while they were in Europe, helped to make the mess worse. He would like to help, but he is unwilling to sign more blank cheques. He is confused; the issue is not clear, and until it is he thinks it safer to keep out. Where Wilson failed, he argues, what reason is there to believe that Harding and Hughes would succeed?
	- There were during the Genoa Conference, when Europe seemed to be doing things on its own account, that American feeling was changing. The disappointing result at Genoa was tragic in its effect upon America. It did help still further to destroy the myth of a romantic France that could do no wrong; but tended to make the country still less disposed to mix in European problems. Yet other factors are at work. The discussion of the tariff, in which the New York banks that give the tone to financial opinion throughout the country are almost unanimously arguing for Free Trade, is very salutary indeed.
	- The Genoa despatches of Mr Keynes and of Mr [Frank Vanderlip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip), the former president of the National City Bank, attracted widespread comment and had a profound educative effect. But the bewildered apathy remains, and while it remains useful American participation in European affairs will be confined to the action of individuals such as Mr Morgan and Mr Vanderlip. It will take some striking event to galvanise American opinion. If the French should undertake independent military action they would certainly be unanimously condemned in this country; such an act might well give the Administration the popular support it requires for an effective return to the councils of Europe.
	- ## The US tariff bill
	- By FW Hirst
	  24 June 1922
	- Under the proposed [Fordney-McCumber Tariff Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff), which the Republican leaders hope to get through this summer, the United States tariff will make import duties on clothing, boots, and most of our staple manufactures almost prohibitive. To quote one paragraph from a very careful analysis by the New York World which lies before me:
	- > Importations would be placed under a virtual embargo, thereby blocking Europe’s only means of paying off her war debt of more than eleven thousand million dollars to the United States. The economically unhealthy gold surplus would remain in this country – over 40 per-cent of the world’s gold supply is now in Federal Revenue bank vaults –instead of flowing back to normal channels and stabilising exchanges.
	- The World declares that the agents of the big industrial monopolies have lobbied at Washington with more success than ever before.

	- President Warren G Harding, circa 1920s. Photograph: AP
	- President Harding has at last signed the new United States Tariff Bill. The Bill, as is well known, conforms to the Republican tradition of high protection, but carries it to a higher power than has ever before been attempted, and considerably higher, one suspects, than most Americans like. How, in that case, it has managed to survive a sustained fire of criticism and is finally to become law on the eve of the congressional elections is a little obscure. As a vote-catching device nothing could have been more unfortunately conceived, and the Democrats are doubtless surprised and delighted to have a weapon with so sharp an edge put into their hands. Their chances at the November elections are now brighter, even though their victory could not immediately enable them to repeal the new tariff.
	- The Bill has been much pulled about during the year it has been under discussion, but in its final shape it is still the most extreme measure of Protection ever passed in an industrial State. It is hardly conceivable that it should last long, and already there are signs of reaction from the frenzied Protectionism in which it had its birth after the sensational collapse in prices and restriction of credit in 1920. It has been carried partly because the Republican party was committed to it, partly because the farmers had to be bribed with heavy duties on all kinds of agricultural produce, and partly because, in spite of a general feeling that the general level of duties was extravagantly high, no trade could be induced to admit that it really needed anything less than prohibition. The Bill, once it was introduced, was carried more by its own momentum than by any active belief in its all-round virtues. It has been carried against much public criticism, and may be followed, like the similar Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909, by Democratic successes at the polls. But, whatever its effects upon the internal politics of America may be, it will probably remain for a year or two as the expression of American tariff policy, and will have far reaching effects upon the trade of America with the rest of the world.
	- From a European point of view the Fordney-McCumber tariff is without any redeeming feature. It fits in only too well with the American policy of self-isolation. This is a policy which can be perfectly well understood even on this side of the Atlantic. If it were practicable there are many who would like to adopt it for England. But even if it were morally defensible to say that the Continent’s troubles are no concern of ours, and that we need not incur the odium and expense of mixing ourselves up in them, it is manifest to everybody that in point of fact that Europe’s troubles are very much our affair and that isolation would be the most dangerous and costly policy of all.
	- In America there is the same inducement to cut clear of a continent which looks like falling to pieces and much less obvious reason why isolation even for her, is impracticable. At least the United States would not starve, as most people in England would, if the whole of her foreign trade were cut off. But though she would not starve she would be a good deal poorer, and she could not profess indifference even to the loss of her trade with Europe, which still takes over half of her total exports and used to take more than that. How much of America’s foreign trade will be destroyed by the new tariff cannot be foreseen. Many of the new duties are described as prohibitive, and a good many more will become so if the President exercises his arbitrary powers of increasing them.

	- As a children’s author, I often visit schools for one-off writing workshops or small residencies but rarely do I have the opportunity to work with students over a longer period. It’s expensive to host an artist, and extended projects can disrupt timetables and regular teaching, so they need to be thoroughly integrated.
	- The undertaking of a more comprehensive project is not just beneficial to students. It also shapes the artist.
	- I always enter the planning stage with expectations and assumptions, and within a week they are dismantled. And, as corny as it sounds, as much as I can teach the students, I always come away feeling that they have taught me much more.
	- This year I’ve spent two months teaching [memoir](https://www.theguardian.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir) writing to students in years 3 to 6. The project is funded by Creative Victoria and is one of many that run annually across the state. Each project sees the pairing of an artist with a school community and together they design an approach to teach students how to express themselves using a particular art form.
	- I came late to writing memoir and, at first, I found it difficult to write about myself. I worried about being seen as arrogant or undeserving. I had people question what I’d done to warrant publishing a book about my life and, initially, I agreed with them. But as I read more published memoirs I began to understand that the form isn’t only a domain for the famous. We all have life stories, we just need to learn how to tell them. It took time to find the confidence to share my experiences but now I find it freeing in a way that writing fiction isn’t always for me. I think students often feel the same.
	- Even without fully developed writing skills, writing your story is accessible. For young people, who often struggle with coming up with an idea or knowing how to start or finish, that can be liberating. They have lived the story, now they just have to work out how to write it. And primary students don’t second-guess themselves when they write. They admit to fears on the page. They talk about emotions. About love. They don’t worry about being judged. They just wade straight in. Regardless of their writing ability, that is a powerful thing.
	- This project was designed as a way to talk about journeys, because many of the students at the school in Melbourne’s outer north have come from other places. But one of the things I love most about working with young people is that, when they take ownership of a project, they make it theirs. And instead of writing about their journeys, many decided to write about moments in their lives that mattered more. A beloved grandfather’s funeral, a family trip to eat halal snack pack, feeling torn between two countries and not knowing where you belong, a fire in a couch started by a younger brother, a declaration of friendship for a student in another class and theme park rollercoasters. So many rollercoasters.
	- Last term we published a book of short memoirs written by the 60 students in the two older grades. We had a launch with snacks and readings, and speeches from the local MP and the principal. To make the event inclusive, a teacher recorded every student reading their memoir then embedded the recordings with QR codes so they could be listened to.
	- We took the project seriously. We gave a voice to kids who don’t always expect to be heard. And we celebrated all of them.
	- At the launch the students clutched their copies of the book and hunted for their names. Then they began to read each other’s work, and share in each other’s stories, and perhaps learning something about someone else that they didn’t know before. The project isn’t assessed and it’s not a curriculum task. It’s about self-expression and learning the value of sharing your story.
	- I believe we all need to experience that. No matter how old we are.

n Tuesday, five days after the independent Makin Report singled him out for criticism over his handling of abuse allegations dating back to the 1970s.
		- Here is what you need to know:
		- ## Who is Justin Welby, and why did he resign?
		- Welby announced his resignation “in sorrow”, taking “personal and institutional responsibility” for a lack of action on the “heinous abuses” allegedly committed by the late John Smyth, a volunteer at Christian summer camps decades ago.
		- “The last few days have renewed my long felt and profound sense of shame at the historic safeguarding failures of the Church of England,” Welby said.
		- Educated at Britain’s most prestigious private school, Eton, Welby worked in the oil industry for more than a decade before being ordained in 1992. He was made the senior prelate of the Church of England in 2013.

		- [Welby](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/12/justin-welby-resigns-as-archbishop-of-canterbury-over-abuse-scandal) was an outspoken spiritual leader of the global Anglican community who grappled publicly with issues ranging from same-sex marriage to Britain’s immigration policy, Israel’s war in Gaza, slavery reparations, climate change and his own mental health problems.
		- ![image](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/AFP__20240125__34GR8BL__v1__HighRes__VaticanReligionPopeEpiphany-1731486353.jpg?w=770\&resize=770%2C559\&quality=80){:width 770 :height 0}

		- ## Who was John Smyth, and what was he accused of?
		- Smyth was an evangelical, Canadian-born, British barrister who held leadership roles in a charity called the Iwerne Trust, which ran Christian camps in England and Wales.
		- Initial details of Smyth’s physical abuse of schoolboys who had attended the camps during the 1970s and 1980s emerged in a 1982 report by the charity.
		- Smyth was reported to have brought pupils from prestigious public schools in England, including Winchester College, to his home, where he lashed them with a cane in his shed.
		- The case was not reported to the police by the trust, the church or the schools whose pupils were subjected to abuse.
		- Instead, Smyth moved to Zimbabwe, where he set up the Zambesi Ministries, which ran similar Christian camps for schoolboys.
		- In 1992 after facing charges of killing a teenage boy who was found dead in a swimming pool, Smyth moved to Cape Town, South Africa.
		- In 2013, a victim reported abuse by Smyth to the [Church of England](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/1/11/church-of-england-says-it-knew-of-slavery-links), which in turn reported the allegations to the police, but an investigation was not initiated.
		- The 1982 Iwerne Trust report was made public in 2016, prompting an investigation by Channel 4 News in 2017.
		- Smyth died the next year in Cape Town at the age of 77.
		- In total, he has been held responsible for the violent abuse of at least 115 children and young men in England, Zimbabwe and South Africa.
		- The report said Smyth had subjected boys and young men to “brutal and horrific” physical and sexual abuse over a 40-year period.
		- Smyth beat some victims with up to 800 strokes of a cane and supplied nappies to absorb the bleeding, the report said.
		- He would then drape himself over his victims, sometimes kissing them on the neck or back.
		- Welby said he had “no idea or suspicion” of the allegations before 2013, but the independent report concluded it was unlikely he would have had no knowledge of the concerns regarding Smyth in the 1980s.
		- ## Who could succeed Welby?
		- Under the church’s rules, the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) is a body of clerics that manages the choice of Welby’s successor.
		- It submits the name of a preferred and an alternative candidate to the United Kingdom’s prime minister, who then advises the monarch on the appointment.
		- It is too early to tell who the CNC will select as Welby’s successor, but there are some likely candidates.
		- Stephen Cottrell, the archbishop of York and the second most senior bishop of the Church of England, will be in the running.
		- Cottrell released a statement after Welby’s resignation, saying it was “the right and honourable thing to do”.
		- A former chief nursing officer in the Department of Health and current bishop of London, Sarah Mullally, could also be in the running. She is the third most senior bishop in the Church of England.
		- ![image](https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-06-29T111905Z_199529310_RC2YK8AUWRE7_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-MUSIC-ST-PAULS-CHOIR-GIRL-1731486803.jpg?w=770\&resize=770%2C565\&quality=80){:width 770 :height 0}
		- Sarah Mullally, the first female bishop of London, at St Paul’s Cathedral in London [File: Isabel Infantes/Reuters]
		- The bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, has been vocal in calling for Welby to step down, which could make her a possible candidate as the Church of England looks to distance itself from the scandal.
		- She has also recently come out as saying she has experienced “coercive language” from Welby and Cottrell in the past.
		- Martyn Snow, the bishop of Leicester; Graham Usher, the bishop of Norwich; and Guli Francis-Dehqani, the bishop of Chelmsford, have all also been tipped to succeed Welby.
		- Snow abstained in a church assembly vote on blessings for gay couples while Usher is in favour of gay rights.
		- Francis-Dehqani was born in Iran and has spoken about how her brother was killed in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution.
		- If a woman is chosen archbishop of Canterbury, she would be the first to occupy the post.
		- ## Has the church faced other abuse allegations in the past?
		- Welby’s resignation comes against the backdrop of widespread historical sexual abuse in the Church of England.
		- A 2022 report by the Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse found that deference to the authority of priests, taboos surrounding the discussion of sexuality and a culture that gave more support to alleged perpetrators than their victims helped make the Church of England “a place where abusers could hide”.

		- [Boomers were born between 1946 and 1964](https://libguides.usc.edu/busdem/age), making them between the ages of 60 and 78 years old. Boomers often have a less-than-stellar reputation, as younger generations see them as out-of-touch old people holding onto an outdated lifestyle while complaining endlessly about how things were better bac>>>>>>>+Updated upstrea

>>>>>>>-Stashed changes
't born into the digital age, which means they grew up in a slower paced world. Boomers would never have believed that someday we'd all walk around with phones in our pockets, let alone phones that were also computers that could connect people in an instant.
		- Technological advances make certain aspects of life easier, but the drawbacks shouldn't be ignored either. Leaning into a boomer lifestyle and adopting some of their habits can be beneficial for everyone, no matter how old you are.
		- ## Here are 10 boomer habits people make fun of that are actually good for you
		- ### 1. Eating dinner at the table
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-dinner-at-table.png){:width 675 :height 380} Monkey Business Images | Shutterstock
		- Boomers might get dragged for eating dinner at 5:30 in the evening and not tipping their servers, yet it turns out that one part of their mealtime routine is actually very good for you: eating dinner at the table, without the distraction of screens.
		- Putting their phones away and eating at the table gives people built-in time to decompress and reconnect. [Intuitive eating counselor Lisa Newman explained](https://www.yourtango.com/family/signs-child-needs-family-dinners) that having a shared family meal leads to healthier eating patterns, along with less family stress and stronger bonds between family members.
		- She acknowledged that it can be super tempting for parents of younger children to pop their kids in front of a screen so they can eat a meal in relative peace and quiet, yet restricting screens around meals teaches kids many essential life skills, like mindful eating, proper manners, and how to have an actual conversation.
		- [Going screen-free for every meal](https://www.yourtango.com/self/parenting-coach-shares-3-step-method-getting-kids-off-screens) might not be possible, yet aiming for one night a week where phones disappear and everyone eats together at the table can be seriously beneficial for the whole family.

		- ### 2. Going to bed early
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-sleep-early.png){:width 675 :height 380} PeopleImages.com - Yuri A. | Shutterstock
		- Another boomer habit people make fun of that's actually good for you is going to bed early. Getting a good night's sleep is often easier said than done, yet as [one public health study](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/17/10740) from the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health revealed, a large portion of people's sleep disturbances have to do with technology.
		- The study noted that taking our phones to bed and being chronically online makes it harder to disconnect and turn our brains off to get the rest we desperately need. Americans today sleep less than 7.5 hours a night on average, which is a major decrease from the amount of sleep people used to get. In 1910, Americans slept for an estimated average of 9 hours a night.
		- Low-quality sleep [can negatively impact people's mental and physical health](https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/things-that-happen-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep), which means that making fun of boomers for tucking in early doesn't make much sense. If younger generations followed in their footsteps and went to bed earlier, it's highly likely they'd feel significantly better than they do now, doom-scrolling until dawn.
		- ### 3. Drinking coffee every morning
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-coffee.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
		- The older people get, the more tied to their routines they become, but in the case of morning coffee, that's a good thing. [Nutrition experts at Johns Hopkins University revealed](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you) that drinking coffee isn't as bad of a habit as people think it is, since coffee has antioxidants and other substances that reduce internal inflammation and protect people from disease. Coffee consumption might even put a stop to certain conditions that are more common for women, including heart disease and Alzheimer's disease.
		- The nutrition experts noted that drinking one to two cups of coffee a day can protect against heart failure and stroke. Drinking coffee can protect your liver and help your body process sugar better. Health benefits aside, [having a morning ritual](https://www.yourtango.com/self/morning-habits-give-you-unfair-advantage-rest-of-day) can keep people feeling balanced and ready to take on the day, which is something everyone needs more of.
		- ### 4. Calling instead of texting
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-phone-call.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
		- Boomers might get made fun of for their communication style, like sending an email, then sending a follow-up text to make sure you got their email, then using the phone in a way Steve Jobs never intended and calling, to tell you they sent you a text. Yet it turns out that calling instead of texting is actually good for you.
		- Despite how connected we are to the digital world, [we live in a lonelier era than ever before](https://www.yourtango.com/self/four-reasons-americans-lonelier-than-people-other-countries). The ease of sending a text cuts people off from each other. Texting might make communication seem more streamlined, but we miss out the joy of hearing our loved ones' voices on the other line.
		- In a conversation with YourTango CEO Andrea Miller on [YourTango's podcast, "Getting Open,"](https://youtu.be/vXMQtVC_QkI?si=bD7vQ0UxXje-JnDc) [psychologist Guy Winch revealed](https://www.yourtango.com/2023367409/it%E2%80%99s-time-swallow-our-pride-and-be-one-who-goes-first) why reaching out to other people is the only way to soothe loneliness.
		- "When you're lonely, you feel so alone, so raw, so rejected, so unseen, that the idea of reaching out and risking more rejection or a rebuff seems more than you can stand, so you don't," he explained. "You see on social media, everyone looks connected, happy, in groups, with friends, and you're sitting by yourself... and you feel like my emotional needs, my connection needs are not being met. And it's that gap that creates loneliness."
		- Winch described loneliness as an emotional wound, saying it's "something that needs healing. It needs proactivity on your part. Wounds, emotional ones, don't usually heal just by themselves that well. They need an assist, like any other wound."
		- He advocated for stepping up and doing the scariest thing imaginable: calling people first.
		- "You need to be brave, you need to start putting together the support as much as you can, and start advocating for yourself, and really start reaching out," he concluded.
		- ### 5. Going to the library
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-going-to-library.png){:width 675 :height 380} polinaloves | Shutterstock
		- It might seem super old-timey to sit quietly, surrounded by stacks of books, but libraries provide so much more than reading material. They're community spaces that offer free or low-cost classes and clubs. Going to the library is a way to stay connected, and the best part about it: it's free!
		- [Visiting the library is one habit](https://www.yourtango.com/self/gen-zers-and-millennials-have-adopted-unlikely-place-their-gathering-spot) that Gen Z and millennials have adopted as their own. They're walking down the road toward nostalgia and finding a wealth of access, along with that elusive "third space" outside of their homes and workplaces where they can go to find in-person communities.
		- **RELATED:** **10 Things Boomer Kids Did Growing Up That Would Make Gen Z Cry**
		- ### 6. Using coupons
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-coupons.png){:width 675 :height 380} PR Image Factory | Shutterstock
		- The idea of collecting coupons might conjure up the image of your grandma, sitting in her bathrobe on Sunday morning, cutting coupons out of the newspaper and storing them alphabetically in one of those little accordion-boxes. Coupons might not be fire, but in a world where groceries are more expensive than ever, using coupons just hits different.
		- Boomers are often criticized for their role in building their wealth in a way that's denied the generations after them that same access, yet their [frugal habits are something younger people can definitely learn from](https://www.yourtango.com/self/daily-habits-frugal-people-make-big-difference).
		- ### 7. Writing by hand
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-writing.png){:width 675 :height 380} Ground Picture | Shutterstock
		- A boomer habit people make fun of that is actually good for you is writing by hand. Typing might be faster than putting pen to paper, but we miss out on major cognitive processes when we don't write by hand. Writing by hand requires the different brain systems to work together.
		- For young kids, writing by hand builds a foundation for literacy later in life by improving memory and word recall. For adults, writing by hand helps people understand complex topics. Handwriting also forces us to slow down and pay attention to what we're putting on the page.
		- [As neuroscientist Ramesh Balasubramaniam explained](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/05/11/1250529661/handwriting-cursive-typing-schools-learning-brain), "There's actually some very important things going on during the embodied experience of writing by hand. It has important cognitive benefits." Writing by hand might seem more work, but it's actually really good for you, and for your brain.
		- ### 8. Fixing broken things instead of replacing them
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-fixing.png){:width 675 :height 380} BAZA Production | Shutterstock
		- Repairing broken things instead of replacing them is a solid way to save money and cut down on waste. Fixing things can also boost your sense of accomplishment since you're learning a new, hands-on skill.
		- Tinkering with a toaster oven might seem like a strange way to spend the weekend, but older appliances are often better built than their modern counterparts, which is an argument for not throwing them away.
		- Not all old-fashioned habits should be overlooked, especially [ones that help you live within your means](https://www.yourtango.com/self/old-fashioned-habits-bring-back-live-frugally). So, channel your inner boomer, strap on your tool belt and start fixing.
		- More for You:
		- ### 9. Walking every day
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-walking.png){:width 675 :height 380} maxbelchenko | Shutterstock
		- Moving our bodies, even just a little every day, is essential for our physical and mental health. [According to the American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2022/11/defeating-depression-naturally), adults who got the recommended amount of weekly exercise, which breaks down to about 2.5 hours of walking, lowered their risk of depression by 25%.
		- [A study from Harvard Medical School](https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510363) discovered that access to nature can actually lower a person's mortality rate. "The truth is, we are nature," [Peter James, a professor at Harvard Medical School, explained](https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/walk-woods-may-boost-mental-health). "We were not evolved to be in a windowless room staring at a computer screen. These artificial environments make us stressed. They force us to focus more than we want to, and they tire our cognitive function."
		- [Walking every day is a simple and effective way](https://www.yourtango.com/experts/reino-gevers/why-walking-good-for-you) to shake up your routine and put your health first.
		- ### 10. Sending thank you notes
		- ![image](https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2024-10/boomer-habits-actually-good-for-you-thank-you-notes.png){:width 675 :height 380} BAZA Production | Shutterstock
		- In an age of email and instant communication, taking the time to write and send a note feels special. It's an act of care and kindness that shows how much you truly appreciate someone.
		- Sending thank you notes is an important part of practicing gratitude, and [it shows you were raised with good manners](https://www.yourtango.com/self/phrases-people-use-raised-good-manners). There's nothing quite like the joy of seeing an envelope addressed to you, amidst piles of junk mail.
		- While some boomer habits are better left in the past, other habits should be brought back, because they actually improve your quality of life.

		- *During the 1920 US presidential election, [Warren G Harding](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/warren-g-harding/) campaigned with the slogan “[return to normalcy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/return-to-normalcy)” – a return to how things were before the first world war. This included deregulation and isolationism. He won with a decisive victory and in 1922 introduced the [Fordney-McCumber Tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff), a law that raised American tariffs on many imported goods.*
		- ## America and Europe
		- From our New York correspondent
		  7 June 1922
		- Most internationally minded American observers who were at [Genoa](https://www.britannica.com/event/Conference-of-Genoa) or have been following recent events from Europe earnestly desire greater American participation in European affairs. Many thoughtful English liberals agree with them. But, curiously enough, many in America who share their hope that the United States may soon appreciate and bear her share of the world’s burdens and problems believe that participation by the American government in European conferences would at this time be futile and perhaps dangerous.
		- [Mr Hughes](https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/hughes-charles-evans) is a man of principle, but Mr Harding is a man of expediency. There is no doubt that the administration would like to take a larger part in European affairs; there is no doubt that the financial interests, to which it lends an attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that financial interest to which it lends and attentive ear, are of the same mind; and there is also no doubt whatever that the mass of American sentiment is steadfastly against it. The huge majority by which Mr Harding defeated the Democratic candidate in the autumn of 1920 was in large part a reaction against Mr Wilson’s entanglement in transatlantic politics.
		- In so far as recent byelections and primary elections can be interpreted as bearing upon foreign policy they show a clear sympathy with the “irreconcilables” who kept the United States out of the League. The Administration, which shifts its domestic policy after every vote in an effort to please the country, would be even more incapable of a clearcut foreign policy.
		- On the Russian question of course the United States has a policy – as intransigent as that of France. Mr Hughes and Mr Hoover, the two strong men of the Cabinet.
		- **A prejudice analysed**
		  The popular prejudice against participation in European affairs is often misinterpreted in [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news). It is, in part, of course, merely content with the relative prosperity in America, a selfish unwillingness to bother about a sick continent so far away. But it is vastly more than that. The figures of private donations for relief in Northern France, in Germany, in Austria, in Russia – which mounted into the tens of millions last year and continue mounting – are one proof of that. To anyone in touch with the pulse of American life it is plain that the main reason for the hesitation to plunge into Europe is a kind of bewildered disappointment at the results of America’s last plunge. There is no confidence in America’s diplomatic wisdom. The ordinary American farmer has two strong convictions – first, that the Europeans are making a mess of things; and, second, that the Americans, while they were in Europe, helped to make the mess worse. He would like to help, but he is unwilling to sign more blank cheques. He is confused; the issue is not clear, and until it is he thinks it safer to keep out. Where Wilson failed, he argues, what reason is there to believe that Harding and Hughes would succeed?
		- There were during the Genoa Conference, when Europe seemed to be doing things on its own account, that American feeling was changing. The disappointing result at Genoa was tragic in its effect upon America. It did help still further to destroy the myth of a romantic France that could do no wrong; but tended to make the country still less disposed to mix in European problems. Yet other factors are at work. The discussion of the tariff, in which the New York banks that give the tone to financial opinion throughout the country are almost unanimously arguing for Free Trade, is very salutary indeed.
		- The Genoa despatches of Mr Keynes and of Mr [Frank Vanderlip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_A._Vanderlip), the former president of the National City Bank, attracted widespread comment and had a profound educative effect. But the bewildered apathy remains, and while it remains useful American participation in European affairs will be confined to the action of individuals such as Mr Morgan and Mr Vanderlip. It will take some striking event to galvanise American opinion. If the French should undertake independent military action they would certainly be unanimously condemned in this country; such an act might well give the Administration the popular support it requires for an effective return to the councils of Europe.
		- ## The US tariff bill
		- By FW Hirst
		  24 June 1922
		- Under the proposed [Fordney-McCumber Tariff Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordney%E2%80%93McCumber_Tariff), which the Republican leaders hope to get through this summer, the United States tariff will make import duties on clothing, boots, and most of our staple manufactures almost prohibitive. To quote one paragraph from a very careful analysis by the New York World which lies before me:
		- > Importations would be placed under a virtual embargo, thereby blocking Europe’s only means of paying off her war debt of more than eleven thousand million dollars to the United States. The economically unhealthy gold surplus would remain in this country – over 40 per-cent of the world’s gold supply is now in Federal Revenue bank vaults –instead of flowing back to normal channels and stabilising exchanges.
		- The World declares that the agents of the big industrial monopolies have lobbied at Washington with more success than ever before.

		- President Warren G Harding, circa 1920s. Photograph: AP
		- President Harding has at last signed the new United States Tariff Bill. The Bill, as is well known, conforms to the Republican tradition of high protection, but carries it to a higher power than has ever before been attempted, and considerably higher, one suspects, than most Americans like. How, in that case, it has managed to survive a sustained fire of criticism and is finally to become law on the eve of the congressional elections is a little obscure. As a vote-catching device nothing could have been more unfortunately conceived, and the Democrats are doubtless surprised and delighted to have a weapon with so sharp an edge put into their hands. Their chances at the November elections are now brighter, even though their victory could not immediately enable them to repeal the new tariff.
		- The Bill has been much pulled about during the year it has been under discussion, but in its final shape it is still the most extreme measure of Protection ever passed in an industrial State. It is hardly conceivable that it should last long, and already there are signs of reaction from the frenzied Protectionism in which it had its birth after the sensational collapse in prices and restriction of credit in 1920. It has been carried partly because the Republican party was committed to it, partly because the farmers had to be bribed with heavy duties on all kinds of agricultural produce, and partly because, in spite of a general feeling that the general level of duties was extravagantly high, no trade could be induced to admit that it really needed anything less than prohibition. The Bill, once it was introduced, was carried more by its own momentum than by any active belief in its all-round virtues. It has been carried against much public criticism, and may be followed, like the similar Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909, by Democratic successes at the polls. But, whatever its effects upon the internal politics of America may be, it will probably remain for a year or two as the expression of American tariff policy, and will have far reaching effects upon the trade of America with the rest of the world.
		- From a European point of view the Fordney-McCumber tariff is without any redeeming feature. It fits in only too well with the American policy of self-isolation. This is a policy which can be perfectly well understood even on this side of the Atlantic. If it were practicable there are many who would like to adopt it for England. But even if it were morally defensible to say that the Continent’s troubles are no concern of ours, and that we need not incur the odium and expense of mixing ourselves up in them, it is manifest to everybody that in point of fact that Europe’s troubles are very much our affair and that isolation would be the most dangerous and costly policy of all.
		- In America there is the same inducement to cut clear of a continent which looks like falling to pieces and much less obvious reason why isolation even for her, is impracticable. At least the United States would not starve, as most people in England would, if the whole of her foreign trade were cut off. But though she would not starve she would be a good deal poorer, and she could not profess indifference even to the loss of her trade with Europe, which still takes over half of her total exports and used to take more than that. How much of America’s foreign trade will be destroyed by the new tariff cannot be foreseen. Many of the new duties are described as prohibitive, and a good many more will become so if the President exercises his arbitrary powers of increasing them.

		- As a children’s author, I often visit schools for one-off writing workshops or small residencies but rarely do I have the opportunity to work with students over a longer period. It’s expensive to host an artist, and extended projects can disrupt timetables and regular teaching, so they need to be thoroughly integrated.
		- The undertaking of a more comprehensive project is not just beneficial to students. It also shapes the artist.

ing that they have taught me much more.
		- This year I’ve spent two months teaching [memoir](https://www.theguardian.com/books/autobiography-and-memoir) writing to students in years 3 to 6. The project is funded by Creative Victoria and is one of many that run annually across the state. Each project sees the pairing of an artist with a school community and together they design an approach to teach students how to express themselves using a particular art form.
		- I came late to writing memoir and, at first, I found it difficult to write about myself. I worried about being seen as arrogant or undeserving. I had people question what I’d done to warrant publishing a book about my life and, initially, I agreed with them. But as I read more published memoirs I began to understand that the form isn’t only a domain for the famous. We all have life stories, we just need to learn how to tell them. It took time to find the confidence to share my experiences but now I find it freeing in a way that writing fiction isn’t always for me. I think students often feel the same.
		- Even without fully developed writing skills, writing your story is accessible. For young people, who often struggle with coming up with an idea or knowing how to start or finish, that can be liberating. They have lived the story, now they just have to work out how to write it. And primary students don’t second-guess themselves when they write. They admit to fears on the page. They talk about emotions. About love. They don’t worry about being judged. They just wade straight in. Regardless of their writing ability, that is a powerful thing.
		- This project was designed as a way to talk about journeys, because many of the students at the school in Melbourne’s outer north have come from other places. But one of the things I love most about working with young people is that, when they take ownership of a project, they make it theirs. And instead of writing about their journeys, many decided to write about moments in their lives that mattered more. A beloved grandfather’s funeral, a family trip to eat halal snack pack, feeling torn between two countries and not knowing where you belong, a fire in a couch started by a younger brother, a declaration of friendship for a student in another class and theme park rollercoasters. So many rollercoasters.
		- Last term we published a book of short memoirs written by the 60 students in the two older grades. We had a launch with snacks and readings, and speeches from the local MP and the principal. To make the event inclusive, a teacher recorded every student reading their memoir then embedded the recordings with QR codes so they could be listened to.
		- We took the project seriously. We gave a voice to kids who don’t always expect to be heard. And we celebrated all of them.
		- At the launch the students clutched their copies of the book and hunted for their names. Then they began to read each other’s work, and share in each other’s stories, and perhaps learning something about someone else that they didn’t know before. The project isn’t assessed and it’s not a curriculum task. It’s about self-expression and learning the value of sharing your story.
		- I believe we all need to experience that. No matter how old we are.

	- [Republicans baffled after Trump picks ‘reckless’ Gaetz for attorney general | Republicans | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/republicans-matt-gaetz-trump-attorney-general)
	  collapsed:: true
		- [Donald Trump’s](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) decision to nominate the far-right Republican congressman [Matt Gaetz](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/who-is-matt-gaetz) as attorney general has sent shockwaves through Washington, including the president-elect’s own party.
		- Trump on Wednesday announced Gaetz as his pick to be the nation’s chief law enforcement officer in the justice department, a role that directs the government’s legal positions on critical issues, including abortion, civil rights, and first amendment cases.
		- Republicans were puzzled over this nomination, expressing this move was not on their “bingo card”.
		- “I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Republican senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-baffles-republican-senators-picking-matt-gaetz-attorney-general-rcna180048). “We need to have a serious attorney general. And I’m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious. This one was not on my bingo card.”
		- A rightwing firebrand, Gaetz was a thorn in the side of his fellow Republican and former House speaker Kevin McCarthy, eventually leading the successful charge to [oust](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/03/kevin-mccarthy-oust-republican-house-speaker-vote-result-matt-gaetz) McCarthy from his role.
		- He was investigated by the justice department in a sex-trafficking case, though the department ultimately [declined to bring charges](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/15/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-case-closed-without-charges). And was under investigation by the House ethics committee amid allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and other alleged ethical breaches.
		- Gaetz has fiercely denied wrongdoing.
		- Amid consternation even within his own party, it’s unclear if Gaetz can win Senate approval.
		- Republican congressman Max Miller of Ohio told [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-republicans-trump-attorney-general) that “Gaetz has a better shot at having dinner with Queen Elizabeth II than being confirmed by the Senate”.
		- Miller also told [Politico](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-attorney-general-confirmation-doubt-00189382) that Gaetz is “a reckless pick” with “a zero percent shot”.
		- John Bolton, a former national security adviser, said Gaetz “must be the worst nomination for a cabinet position in American history”.
		- “Gaetz is not only totally incompetent for this job, he doesn’t have the character. He is a person of moral turpitude,” Bolton said in an interview with [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/matt-gaetz-must-be-the-worst-cabinet-nomination-in-american-history-amb-john-bolton-224379461670).
		- One anonymous House GOP member told [Axios](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/13/matt-gaetz-republicans-trump-attorney-general): “We wanted him out of the House … this isn’t what we were thinking.” Another remarked they were “stunned and disgusted”.
		- Democrats, too, were left astonished by the announcement. Vice-President Kamala Harris’s team said in a statement that Trump and Gaetz “will weaponize the DoJ to protect themselves and their allies”.
		- Congressman Ro Khanna of California argued that voters were not necessarily voting for these cabinet picks when they decided to elect Trump.
		- “People voted for Trump to have lower prices and a secure border. I don’t think they voted for the appointments that they’re getting,” Khanna told [CBS News](https://x.com/CBSNews/status/1856833480312984003). “He is not moving to the center. He’s going to his Maga base, and we’ll see if he’s overreaching on the mandate he had from the American people.”
		- Kate Maeder, a California-based political strategist, said the announcement should not come as a surprise, but wondered whether Trump trusts Gaetz will make it through the confirmation process. “It’s not a surprise that Trump is rewarding his political loyalists,” Maeder told the Guardian. “It’s a shock to many that he’s considering Matt Gaetz for attorney general. But is this a serious pick? I don’t think so.”
		- “In this political climate, it’s definitely possible for Matt Gaetz to be confirmed,” she said. “But I think it’ll be difficult. Some of the more moderate Republican senators are already on record questioning this choice.”

		- Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
		- Lately, I’ve been on a mission to simplify my digital footprint. While tools like [Notion](https://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-use-notion-3497921/) and [Anytype](https://www.androidauthority.com/notion-alternative-anytype-3493145/) have come in handy to bulk optimize my life, I find simplicity is key when it comes to writing or note-taking. I’ve tried documenting my work, life, and more in some of the [best diary and journal apps](https://www.androidauthority.com/best-diary-apps-journal-apps-android-892375/) like Notion, but I reverted to Google Keep for the longest time. It was easy enough to use, available everywhere, and it backed up everything neatly — sounds perfect, doesn’t it?
		- It worked fine, but my needs have evolved since then. As Google Keep tacks on new features, it’s become a bit too bloated for my needs, and the interface’s lack of focus on long-form writing started irking me. So, I looked for the perfect alternative. That’s when I struck upon SimpleNote.
		- ### Is Google Keep your primary note-taking app?
		- 758 votes
		- Some of you might suggest that I should’ve looked at Google Docs as the obvious upgrade from Google Keep. However, every time I entertained that idea, I always landed on six essential features that made Simplenote a non-negotiable upgrade for me.
		- ## Offline support
		- ![image](https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Simplenote-sync-with-phone.jpg){:width 770 :height 433}
		- Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
		- As I draft this article, I’m sitting at a coffee shop working from my [MacBook Air](https://www.androidauthority.com/macbook-air-m3-silicon-3434607/) with practically non-existent connectivity. Previously, this would have meant a no-go as Google Keep lacks offline support on computers.
		- Up in the air, or at a cafe with limited connectivity, Simplenote lets me continue my work.
		- Simplenote solves that issue. The app is designed from the ground up for writing with first-class offline support. When you’re back online, it’ll sync everything to the cloud. It’s as simple as that. In the post-COVID era, I found that I was traveling a lot more frequently for work or pleasure and needed a tool that would work just as seamlessly up in the air or in my office. Solving this one issue was one of my main reasons to look for an alternative.
		- ## Native apps
		- ![image](https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Simplenote-features.jpg){:width 770 :height 493}
		- Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
		- While there’s no dearth of note-taking apps, many of my preferred options were web-first and lacked offline support on desktops. That’s not an issue with Simplenote since it has native apps for every platform it targets. This includes all popular platforms, including Mac, PC, Android, iOS, and web.
		- Moreover, Simplenote’s app is simple, but not to a fault. The interface is clean, with easy tag-based organization for sorting your notes, and that’s about it.
		- There are ample tools and utilities to be found that I’ll get to in a bit, but by and large, it just presents a large blank canvas for users to write — and does it well. Organization is done using tags, similar to the labels feature in Google Keep. While I’d have appreciated folder-based organization similar to iA Writer, it’s not a huge detriment to my workflow.
		- Simplenote is simple to use but has all the essential features.
		- Essentials like a word counter, character counter, creation data, and more are just a tap away which makes it easy for me to keep a tab on word counts while writing out drafts. Like a pseudo wiki, you can even interlink documents with each other using internal links.
		- Elsewhere, Simplenote’s mobile apps are excellent. The interface is practically identical across desktop and mobile platforms — both in terms of aesthetics and functionality. I often edit notes and drafts on my [OnePlus Open](https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-open-review-3378603/), and with the screen open wide, the experience is effectively the same as on my Mac or iPad.
		- Additionally, I love how quickly Simplenote synchronizes files. All changes are reflected in near real-time, and if you have the app open on your phone while working on a computer, you can see the words pop up moments after you type them out. This gives me additional peace of mind that my notes are being safely backed up.
		- ## Markdown support
		- If you’re unaware of markdown, you’re in for a treat. The markup language makes it easy to write fully formatted text in a plain-text editor. Think using an asterisk for italics, and double asterisk for bold. It even makes it easy to define headline sizes. This text is easily transportable across apps and tools while retaining its formatting.
		- Markdown support makes it a breeze to move notes between apps and content management services.
		- As Simplenote supports Markdown, I can write out my draft copy to my liking, copy and paste it to a CMS, or copy it over to an app like Obsidian for archival purposes. It’s great and essential for a user like me who moves across multiple content management systems and tools daily.
		- ## Collaboration and publishing
		- ![image](https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/simplenote-collaboration.jpg){:width 770 :height 442}
		- Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
		- Hidden behind that barebones interface is a surprisingly robust feature set. Like Google Keep, you can add collaborators to your notes. It is as easy as tagging users by their email address, and they’ll be invited to the note. From there on, both users will be able to work on the document. It’s almost like Google Docs but much more straightforward and, dare I say, cleaner.
		- ![image](https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Simplenote-Publishing.png){:width 770 :height 485}
		- Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
		- Additionally, there’s one more feature that I find very handy. Just like Notion, Simplenote lets you publish notes on the web. So, for example, if you want to share a shopping list or something you wrote without giving readers the ability to edit it, Simplenote will let you publish it as a web page. I maintain a list of interesting quotes I’ve come across while reading and have it published on the internet for anyone to read. You can check it out [here](https://app.simplenote.com/publish/TpyXPH).
		- ## Easy export
		- ![image](https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/simplenote-export.jpg){:width 770 :height 622}
		- Dhruv Bhutani / Android Authority
		- I’ve talked about it multiple times, but the ability to move my data is critical to me every time I commit to an app. In fact, I seriously considered splurging a nosebleed amount on iA Writer for its local markdown files support. Even though Simplenote doesn’t let you access individual note files on your computer, exporting all your notes and files is a two-step process.
		- These individual markdown files can then be comfortably imported into any other note-taking or productivity app, where they will maintain all formatting and tags.
		- ## Free
		- I’m not averse to subscription services, or apps with a one-time fee — within reason. Before settling on Simplenote, I spent a lot of time testing out iA Writer. As good as the app is, I couldn’t get myself to pay $50 per platform in addition to a subscription on Android. Simply put, a hundred dollars and a subscription fee is a lot of money to pay for a note-taking app.
		- Barring a few quality-of-life features, Simplenote offers a very similar experience to paid apps for free. What's not to like?
		- So for me, there’s a clear winner in the Google Keep vs. Simplenote battle. I’ve been using Simplenote as my primary note-taking platform for well over a year now, and it has never failed me. The app is clean, consistently keeps my notes in sync, and I can easily move the unformatted text to any other app of my choice. Sure, it misses out on features like background colors or the ability to insert images, but I don’t miss those at all. Simplicity and a pure writing experience are why I shifted to a dedicated note-taking app, and Simplenote delivers that in spades.

		- You can’t say it was a fluke. If in 2016, Donald Trump’s novelty, combined with his loss of the popular vote, allowed liberals to retain a bit of plausible deniability about what his presidential win meant about America, this time, there is no such comfort. [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) is no longer a mystery or an amusing diversion: no one can claim that they do not understand full extent of his malignant corruption, or the seriousness of his movement’s hostility to pluralist democracy. And he won the popular vote.
		- Many postmortems of last week’s election have tried to preserve the notion that Trump’s voter’s did not endorse him and his vision – that they know not what they do. This is dishonest, and a bit patronizing toward Trump’s supporters. Trump’s voters, for the most part, know exactly what he is, and what voting for him means. They are not ignorant or mistaken about him. They endorse him and what he is.
		- A large part of what a majority of Americans voted for last week was the Trump campaign’s virulent misogyny. Trump himself, an adjudicated rapist who has bragged about both committing sexual assault and engineering the reversal of Roe v Wade, speaks of women in vulgar, degrading terms. He picked a running mate who has denigrated childless women as “psychotic” “cat ladies”. His adviser and funder Elon Musk, who seems to have designs on becoming something of a shadow president in Trump’s second term, is a techno-fascist pro-natalist who goes around [offering](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/elon-musk-father-child-taylor-swift-disgust-creepy-1236140915/) women insemination.
		- The Trump campaign positioned itself as a champion of a hierarchical gender order, aiming to restore men to a place of wrongfully deprived supremacy over women. Many of his voters cast their lot in with Trump hoping that he would do just that.
		- Now, after Trump’s victory, some of his supporters have adopted a slogan which neatly joins the movement’s twin projects of forced sex and forced pregnancy: “Your body, my choice.”
		- “Your body, my choice,” was coined by the far-right, pro-Nazi internet troll and Trump dinner guest Nick Fuentes on the night of the election. “Your body, my choice,” Fuentes tweeted. “Forever.” It’s a taunting inversion of the pro-choice slogan “my body, my choice”, meant to assert women’s autonomy: instead, “your body, my choice” presents women’s full citizenship and freedom as laughable, asserting, in gleeful terms, the male supremacy that will now carry for the force of policy and law under a new Trump administration.
		- In response to Fuentes’s post, pro-Trump men have adopted the slogan en masse to troll women online. An analysis from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue found that the use of the phrase soared on social media in the days following the election, along with similar misogynist phrases like “get back in the kitchen”, and the use of sexist slurs directed at liberal and progressive women like Kamala Harris and Rachel Maddow. Female TikTok users reported a flood of such comments, with “your body, my choice” chief among them on the platform. And young girls in schools, along with their teachers and parents, reported incidents of the phrase being yelled out by boys in taunting jeers of harassment and intimidation in the days following the election.
		- “Your body, my choice” is a rejection of women’s rights to control their own bodies in more ways than one. In addition to the phrase’s sneering inversion of a pro-choice phrase, rejecting the abortion right and claiming the overturn of Roe as a victory for men, the phrase has a second, dual meaning: as a rape threat. The men and boys who use it are not merely taunting women with the threat of an unwanted, forced pregnancy. They are taunting them with the threat of forced sex.
		- It is not always a connection that the misogynist right has made so explicit. In other eras, the anti-choice movement has adopted an overtly religious attitude of sexual repression, aiming to restrict abortion as a means of restricting sexuality across the board. But this preacherly, sexually repressed masculinity is not the masculinity of today’s misogynist rightwing movement. Rather, the Maga right is one that sees sex not as something that must be rendered shameful and pushed out of the public sphere, but as a weapon that can be used to punish, humiliate and dominate women.
		- This new, avowedly and vulgarly sexual rightwing masculinity is what Fuentes was crystalizing in his snide little coinage of “your body, my choice”: it is one that aims to use physical and sexual force to coerce women into a degraded gendered role, one subject to men’s domination and only partial, limited and conditional in its citizenship and access to the public sphere. In this sense, their projects in joyfully celebrating rape and restricting women’s access to abortion are two sides of the same coin: the right seeks to dominate women and to commandeer the inside of their bodies so as to force them into a gendered role against their will, be that role as sex object or as mother.

		- This is why it is fitting that Trump, who was found liable for the rape of one woman and accused of sexual assault by two dozen others, was the president to secure the overturning of Roe v Wade; it is why it is fitting that two of the justices who voted to overturn Roe, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, have been credibly accused of sexual misconduct, each by more than one woman. It is because the sex politics of the right is not an anti-sex, puritanical politics. It is a politics of sexual domination.
		- There is no use pretending that this is not what the Trump movement is. And there is no use in pretending that this is not what many of the men who voted for Trump hoped to achieve when they supported him. Much of the pre-election coverage of the gender dynamics of Trump’s campaign has disappeared in the days following the election, and perhaps this unpleasant reality is why: most Americans voted for a man they have every reason to believe is a rapist. For some of them, at least, that was not a liability, but an asset.

		- Our mistake was to think we lived in a better country than we do. Our mistake was to see the joy, the extraordinary balance between idealism and pragmatism, the energy, the generosity, the coalition-building of the [Kamala Harris](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris) campaign and think that it must triumph over the politics of lies and resentment. Our mistake was to think that racism and misogyny were not as bad as they are, whether it applied to who was willing to vote for a supremely qualified Black woman or who was willing to vote for an adjudicated rapist and convicted criminal who admires Hitler. Our mistake was to think we could row this boat across the acid lake before the acid dissolved it.
		- We knew what the problems were, and we wanted to fix them. The principal problems that got us to this bleakest moment in American history are intertwined. They are the crisis of masculinity, the failure of the mainstream news media and the rise of [Silicon Valley](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/silicon-valley), and in a way they are all the same problem.
		- The media might be the simplest to describe. A democracy requires an informed citizenry, and the US media over the past eight years in particular created an increasingly misinformed citizenry.
		- When people are more concerned that a trans girl might play on a softball team than that the [climate crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis) might profoundly devastate the biosphere and much of life on it, human and otherwise, for the next 10,000 years, the media has failed. When people worry about crime when it is low, an economy when it is thriving and immigrants when they do much of the hard work that sustains that economy and commit fewer crimes than the native-born, the media has failed.
		- When it came to [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), they went easy on him, and they again and again let him and the far right set the agenda. They constantly treated asymmetrical issues as symmetrical ones – if the Democrats resisted Republican outrages, both sides were “polarized”. In the media everything had two sides, even if one side was the truth and the other was the lie, one side was the human rights or the law and the other side was their violation.
		- They went soft on Trump’s criminality and incompetence, and his sheer volume of scandals meant that the past ones were forgotten as the next one erupted. He would not have won his 2016 minority victory had the US news media adequately conveyed that Trump was not the fun fictional character in the reality TV show The Apprentice; he was a serially bankrupt man repeatedly accused of sexual assault with a lot of criminal ties and a history of not paying his bills, being helped on by the Vladimir Putin regime, which had itself seriously corrupted the information environment of the election.
		- Of course what the Putin regime did with its hacking and leaking, its troll farms stirring up strife and spreading misinformation, was exploit vulnerabilities that Silicon Valley had created, and that Silicon Valley was not interested in fixing as long as the profits rolled in. Silicon Valley was created by white men and perhaps because the immensely wealthy titans of the industry that arose initially seemed harmlessly nerdy, or perhaps because the US government at the time when the mega-corporations arose was so neoliberal, they were never held in check as their enterprises came to dominate the world in significant ways.
		- Social media arose like a school of sharks in the information pool and began to devour the economic base of the news industry, to undermine the filtration systems that had limited the spread of hate, lies, misinformation and disinformation. But to talk about it as an information pool is to underestimate how much it has changed consciousness itself, how addictive and how distorting it is, how it manipulates values and emotions and beliefs.
		- Young men seem particularly vulnerable to its offerings, and many dank corners of the internet recruit them into misogyny and white supremacy via influencers and incel subcultures, into antisemitism and conspiracy theories, and more than that into becoming unmoored, destabilized, unwell, isolated.
		- The Maga right with its indifference to the normal issues of good governance and its preoccupation with clickbait distractions is an online monster and it has succeeded in creating a more angry, aggressive form of masculinity, one more convinced that debasing and dominating women is essential to its identity, whether in porn or in Trump’s fantasizing aloud that Liz Cheney should [face a firing squad](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/liz-cheney-donald-trump-dictator) and Harris face Mike Tyson. The endless memes of Trump as Rambo and rescuers and Jesus show how much the lost boys and Maga women want an authoritarian leader, and the fact they can make one out of the physically and mentally pathetic Trump is a testimony to the power of tech-fueled fantasy.
		- Of course Silicon Valley, media and the crisis in masculinity converge in [Elon Musk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk), who used his ownership of Twitter and his monstrous wealth to push Trump’s campaign along and who apparently intends to be the power behind the throne. Musk has become increasingly unhinged and far-right himself. Strikingly, two other men close to Trump have also become increasingly delusional – Tucker Carlson with his recent [claims](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/tucker-carlson-demon-war-room-podcast) about being [attacked by demons](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/tucker-carlson-demon-attack), and Robert F Kennedy Jr, with his nonsensical rantings about [fluoridation](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/fluoride-explainer-what-is-us-election-donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-jr) and [racist claims](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/19/robert-kennedy-jr-racist-antisemitic-xenophobic-views) about Covid-19. [JD Vance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance), formerly a not very successful venture capitalist, was [chosen by Silicon Valley](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/19/jd-vance-trump-vp-pick-silicon-valley) oligarchs as Trump’s vice-president and himself seems to have become a far-right extremist with an obsession about obligatory childbearing.
		- They appear to be deeply damaged people and they have come to damage everything else, including the climate; human rights, especially women’s rights, trans rights and immigrants’ rights; and the [US economy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy). The rest of us and the rest of the world will be the cleanup crew because men like this never clean up after themselves.

		- HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - The city confirmed Wednesday two meetings to gather additional community feedback on plans for a new pedestrian bridge over the Ala Wai Canal.
		- The proposed Ala Wai Pedestrian Bridge (also known as Ala Pono) will be aligned with University Avenue on the Moiiliili side of the Ala Wai canal and Kalaimoku Street on the Waikiki side.
		- “The Ala Pono Pedestrian Bridge is a key component of the City’s Complete Streets network of bicycle and pedestrian paths,” said Honolulu Department of Transportation Director Roger Morton. “This project has generated tremendous interest from the public regarding the final form of this new structure, and the City is committed to soliciting additional public input on the final form of the bridge.”
		- The two workshops will be held on Wednesday, Nov. 20, from 6 to 9 p.m. and Saturday Nov. 23, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Ala Wai Elementary School, 503 Kamoku St., adjacent to the proposed bridge site.
		- The city will present a variety of bridge types and collect public feedback. The results will be incorporated in the city’s Design-Build Request for Proposal (RFP), which is expected to be issued next year.
		- [Learn more about the project here.](https://www8.honolulu.gov/dts/ala-pono/)
		- The city plans to award a contract next year with construction expected to last three years.
		- Thanks to previous community feedback, the city has already adjusted its plans to:
			- Reconfigure the existing comfort station adjacent to the proposed pedestrian bridge, to include additional facilities; and
			- Build a new canoe halau adjacent to the bridge.
		- The Ala Pono Bridge project is led by DTS in partnership with the Hawaii Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration.

		  Until a couple of years ago, Lucy Calkins was, to many American teachers and parents, a minor deity. Thousands of U.S. schools used her curriculum, called Units of Study, to teach children to read and write. Two decades ago, her guiding principles—that children learn best when they love reading, and that teachers should try to inspire that love—became a centerpiece of the curriculum in New York City’s public schools. Her approach spread through an institute she founded at Columbia University’s Teachers College, and traveled further still via teaching materials from her publisher. Many teachers don’t refer to Units of Study by name. They simply say they are “teaching Lucy.”

		  But now, at the age of 72, Calkins faces the destruction of everything she has worked for. [A 2020 report by a nonprofit](https://achievethecore.org/page/3240/comparing-reading-research-to-program-design-an-examination-of-teachers-college-units-of-study) described Units of Study as “beautifully crafted” but “unlikely to lead to literacy success for _all_ of America’s public schoolchildren.” The criticism became impossible to ignore two years later, when the American Public Media podcast [_Sold a Story: How Teaching Kids to Read Went So Wrong_](https://features.apmreports.org/sold-a-story/) accused Calkins of being one of the reasons so many American children struggle to read. (The National Assessment of Educational Progress—a test administered by the Department of Education—found in 2022 that roughly one-third of fourth and eighth graders are unable to read at the “basic” level for their age.)
		  
		  In _Sold a Story_, the reporter Emily Hanford argued that teachers had fallen for a single, unscientific idea—and that its persistence was holding back American literacy. The idea was that “beginning readers don’t have to sound out words.” That meant teachers were no longer encouraging early learners to use phonics to decode a new word—to say _cuh_-_ah_-_tuh_ for “cat,” and so on. Instead, children were expected to figure out the word from the first letter, context clues, or nearby illustrations. But this “cueing” system was not working for large numbers of children, leaving them floundering and frustrated. The result was a reading crisis in America.
		  
		  The podcast said that “a company and four of its top authors” had sold this “wrong idea” to teachers and politicians. The company was the educational publisher Heinemann, and the authors included the New Zealander Marie Clay, the American duo Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell, and Calkins. The podcast devoted an entire episode, “[The Superstar](https://www.apmreports.org/episode/2022/11/03/sold-a-story-e4-the-superstar),” to Calkins. In it, Hanford wondered if Calkins was wedded to a “romantic” notion of literacy, where children would fall in love with books and would then somehow, magically, learn to read. Calkins could not see that her system failed poorer children, Hanford argued, because she was “influenced by privilege”; she had written, for instance, that children might learn about the alphabet by picking out letters from their surroundings, such as “the monogram letters on their bath towels.”
		  
		  In Hanford’s view, it was no surprise if Calkins’s method worked fine for wealthier kids, many of whom arrive at school already starting to read. If they struggled, they could always turn to private tutors, who might give the phonics lessons that their schools were neglecting to provide. But kids without access to private tutors needed to be drilled in phonics, Hanford argued. She backed up her claims by referencing neurological research into how children learn to read—gesturing to a body of evidence known as “the science of reading.” That research demonstrated the importance of regular, explicit phonics instruction, she said, and ran contrary to how American reading teachers were being trained.
		  
		  Since the podcast aired, “teaching Lucy” has fallen out of fashion. Calkins’s critics say that her refusal to acknowledge the importance of phonics has tainted not just Units of Study—a reading and writing program that stretches up to eighth grade—but her entire educational philosophy, known as “balanced literacy.” Forty states and the District of Columbia have passed laws or implemented policies promoting the science of reading in the past decade, according to _Education Week_, and publishers are racing to adjust their offerings to embrace that philosophy.
		  
		  Somehow, the wider debate over how to teach reading has become a referendum on Calkins herself. In September 2023, [Teachers College announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/08/us/lucy-calkins-teachers-college.html) that it would dissolve the reading-and-writing-education center that she had founded there. Anti-Lucy sentiment has proliferated, particularly in the city that once championed her methods: Last year, David Banks, then the chancellor of New York City public schools, likened educators who used balanced literacy to lemmings: “We all march right off the side of the mountain,” he said. _The New Yorker_ has described Calkins’s approach as “[literacy by vibes](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy),” and in an editorial, the _New York Post_ described her initiative as [“a disaster” that had been “imposed on generations of American children.”](https://nypost.com/2023/09/17/columbia-quietly-closes-down-teachers-college-project-that-ruined-countless-lives/) The headline declared that it had “Ruined Countless Lives.” When the celebrated Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker shared an article about Calkins on X, he bemoaned “the scandal of ed schools that promote reading quackery.” Queen Lucy has been dethroned.
		  
		  “I mean, I can say it—it was a little bit like 9/11,” Calkins told me when we spoke at her home this summer. On that day in 2001, she had been driving into New York City, and “literally, I was on the West Side Highway and I saw the plane crash into the tower. Your mind can’t even comprehend what’s happening.” Two decades later, the suggestion that she had harmed children’s learning felt like the same kind of gut punch.
		  
		  Calkins now concedes that some of the problems identified in _Sold a Story_ were real. But she says that she had followed the research, and was trying to rectify issues even before the podcast debuted: She released her first dedicated phonics units in 2018, and later published a series of “decodable books”—simplified stories that students can easily sound out. Still, she has not managed to satisfy her critics, and on the third day we spent together, she admitted to feeling despondent. “What surprises me is that I feel as if I’ve done it all,” she told me. (Heinemann, Calkins’s publisher, has claimed that the _Sold a Story_ podcast “[radically oversimplifies and misrepresents complex literacy issues](https://blog.heinemann.com/heinemann-statement-in-response-to-apm-reports).”)
		  
		  The backlash against Calkins strikes some onlookers, even those who are not paid-up Lucy partisans, as unfair. “She wouldn’t have been my choice for the picture on the ‘wanted’ poster,” James Cunningham, a professor emeritus of literacy studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, told me. Indeed, over the course of several days spent with Calkins, and many more hours talking with people on all sides of this debate, I came to see her downfall as part of a larger story about the competing currents in American education and the universal desire for an easy, off-the-shelf solution to the country’s reading problems.
		  
		  The question now is whether Calkins is so much a part of the problem that she cannot be part of the solution. “I’m going to figure this out,” she remembered thinking. “And I’m going to clarify it or I’m going to write some more or speak or do something or, or—_fix it_.” But can she? Can anyone?
		  
		  On the last day of the school year in Oceanside, a well-to-do town on Long Island, everyone was just _delighted_ to see Lucy Calkins. The young Yale-educated principal of Fulton Avenue School 8, Frank Zangari, greeted her warmly, and at the end of one lesson, a teacher asked for a selfie.
		  
		  The lessons I saw stressed the importance of self-expression and empathy with other viewpoints; a group of sixth graders told me about the books they had read that year, which explored being poor in India and growing up Black in 1960s America. In every class, I watched Calkins speak to children with a mixture of intense attention and straightforward challenge; she got down on the floor with a group learning about orcas and frogs and peppered them with questions about how animals breathe. “Could you talk a minute about the writer’s craft?” she asked the sixth graders studying poetry. “Be more specific. Give examples,” she told a fourth grader struggling to write a memoir.
		  
		  With her slim frame, brown bob, and no-nonsense affect, she reminded me of Nancy Pelosi. “I can’t retire; I don’t have any hobbies,” I overheard her saying to someone later.
		  
		  Calkins has profited handsomely from textbook sales and training fees.
		  
		  School 8 showed the strengths of Calkins’s approach—which is presumably why she had suggested we visit it together. But it also hinted at the downsides. For generations in American public education, there has been a push and pull between two broad camps—one in which teachers are encouraged to directly impart skills and information, and a more progressive one in which children are thought to learn best through firsthand experience. When it comes to reading, the latter approach dominates universities’ education programs and resonates with many teachers; helping children see themselves as readers and writers feels more emotionally satisfying than drilling them on diphthongs and trigraphs.
		  
		  This tension between the traditionalists and the progressives runs through decades of wrangling over standardized tests and through most of the major curricular controversies in recent memory. Longtime educators tick off the various flash points like Civil War battlefields: outcome-based education, No Child Left Behind, the Common Core. Every time, the pendulum went one way and then the other. “I started teaching elementary school in 1964,” says P. David Pearson, a former dean at the Berkeley School of Education, in California. “And then I went to grad school in, like, ’67, and there’s been a back-to-the-basics swing about every 10 years in the U.S., consistently.”
		  
		  The progressives’ primary insight is that lessons focused on repetitive instruction and simplified text extracts can be boring for students and teachers alike, and that many children respond more enthusiastically to discovering their own interests. “We’re talking about an approach that treats kids as competent, intellectual meaning makers, versus kids who just need to learn the code,” Maren Aukerman, a professor at the University of Calgary, told me. But opponents see that approach as nebulous and undirected.
		  
		  My time at School 8 was clearly intended to demonstrate that Units of Study is not hippie nonsense, but a rigorous curriculum that can succeed with the right teachers. “There’s no question in my mind that the philosophy works, but in order to implement it, it takes a lot of work,” Phyllis Harrington, the district superintendent, told me.
		  
		  School 8 is a happy school with great results. However, while the school uses Calkins’s writing units for all grades, it uses her reading units only from the third grade on. For first and second grades, the school uses Fundations, which is marketed as “a proven approach to Structured Literacy that is aligned with the science of reading.” In other words, it’s a phonics program.
		  
		  Calkins’s upbringing was  financially comfortable but psychologically tough. Both of her parents were doctors, and her father eventually chaired the department of medicine at the University at Buffalo. Calkins’s mother was “the most important, wonderful person in my life, but really brutal,” she told me. If a bed wasn’t made, her mother ripped off the sheets. If a coat wasn’t hung up, her mother dropped it into the basement. When the young Lucy bit her fingernails, her mother tied dancing gloves onto her hands. When she scratched the mosquito bites on her legs, her mother made her wear thick pantyhose at the height of summer.
		  
		  The nine Calkins children raised sheep and chickens themselves. Her memories of childhood are of horseback riding in the cold, endless hand-me-downs, and little tolerance for bad behavior.
		  
		  That is why, Calkins told me, “nothing that Emily Hanford has said grates on me more than the damn monogrammed towels.” But she knows that the charge of being privileged and out of touch has stuck. Her friends had warned her about letting me into her home in Dobbs Ferry, a pretty suburb of New York, and I could see why. Her house is idyllic—at the end of a long private drive, shaded by old trees, with a grand piano in the hallway and a Maine-coon cat patrolling the wooden floors. Calkins has profited handsomely from textbook sales and training fees, and in the eyes of some people, that is suspicious. (“Money is the last thing I ever think about,” she told me.)
		  
		  She became interested in reading and writing because she babysat for the children of the literacy pioneer Donald Graves, whose philosophy can be summarized by one of his most widely cited phrases: “Children want to write.” Even at a young age, she believed in exhaustively prepared fun. “I would plan a bagful of things I would bring over there; I was the best babysitter you could ever have,” she said. “We would do crafts projects, and drama, you know, and I would keep the kids busy all day.”
		  
		  When Calkins was 14, Graves sent her to be a counselor at a summer camp in rural Maine. She remembers two kids in particular, Sophie and Charlie. Sophie was “so tough and surly, and a kind of overweight, insecure, tough kid,” but she opened up when Calkins took her horseback riding and then asked her to write about it. Charlie loved airplanes, and so she asked him to write about those. The experience cemented her lifelong belief that children should read and write as a form of self-expression.
		  
		  After graduating from Williams College in 1973, she enrolled in a program in Connecticut that trained teachers to work in disadvantaged districts. She read everything about teaching methods she could find, and traveled to England, where a progressive education revolution was in full swing.
		  
		  Calkins returned to America determined to spread this empowering philosophy. She earned a doctorate at NYU, and, in 1986, published a book called [_The Art of Teaching Writing_](https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780435088095). Later, she expanded her purview to reading instruction.
		  
		  At the time, the zeitgeist favored an approach known as “whole language.” This advocated independent reading of full books and suggested that children should identify words from context clues rather than arduously sounding them out. Progressives loved it, because it emphasized playfulness and agency. But in practice, whole language had obvious flaws: Some children do appear to pick up reading easily, but many benefit from focused, direct instruction.
		  
		  This approach influenced Calkins as she developed her teaching philosophy. “Lucy Calkins sides, in most particulars, with the proponents of ‘whole language,’ ” _The New York Times_ reported in 1997. Her heavyweight 2001 book, _The Art of Teaching Reading_, has only a single chapter on phonics in primary grades; it does note, however, that “researchers emphasize how important it is for children to develop phonemic awareness in kindergarten.”
		  
		  The author Natalie Wexler has described Calkins’s resulting approach, balanced literacy, as an attempt to create a “peace treaty” in the reading wars: Phonics, yes, if you must, but also writing workshops and independent reading with commercial children’s books, rather than the stuffier grade-level decodable texts and approved extracts. (Defenders of the former method argue that using full books is more cost-efficient, because they can be bought cheaply and used by multiple students.) “If we make our children believe that reading has more to do with matching letters and sounds than with developing relationships with characters like Babar, Madeline, Charlotte, and Ramona,” Calkins wrote, “we do more harm than good.”
		  
		  Sentences like that are why critics saw balanced literacy as a branding exercise designed to rehabilitate old methods. “It was a strategic rebadging of whole language,” Pamela Snow, a cognitive-psychology professor at La Trobe University, in Australia, told me. Even many of Calkins’s defenders concede that she was too slow to embrace phonics as the evidence for its effectiveness grew. “I think she should have reacted earlier,” Pearson, the former Berkeley dean, told me, but he added: “Once she changed, they were still beating her for what she did eight years ago, not what she was doing last month.”
		  
		  For the first decades of her career, Calkins was an influential thinker among progressive educators, writing books for teachers. In 2003, though, Joel Klein, then the chancellor of the New York City public schools, suddenly mandated her workshop approach in virtually all of the city’s elementary schools, alongside a separate, much smaller, phonics program. An article in the _Times_ suggested that some saw Klein as “[an unwitting captive of the city’s liberal consensus](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/education/new-york-s-new-approach.html),” but Klein brushed aside the criticisms of balanced literacy. “I don’t believe curriculums are the key to education,” he said. “I believe teachers are.” Now everybody in the city’s public schools would be “teaching Lucy.”
		  
		  As other districts followed New York’s lead, Units of Study became one of the most popular curricula in the United States. This led, inevitably, to backlash. A philosophy had become a product—an extremely popular and financially successful one. “Once upon a time there was a thoughtful educator who raised some interesting questions about how children were traditionally taught to read and write, and proposed some innovative changes,” [the author Barbara Feinberg wrote in 2007](https://www.educationnext.org/the-lucy-calkins-project/). “But as she became famous, critical debate largely ceased: her word became law. Over time, some of her methods became dogmatic and extreme, yet her influence continued to grow.”
		  
		  You wouldn’t know it from listening to her fiercest detractors, but Calkins has, in fact, continuously updated Units of Study. Unlike Irene Fountas and Gay Su Pinnell, who have stayed quiet during the latest furor and quietly reissued their curriculum with more emphasis on phonics last year, Calkins has even taken on her critics directly. In 2019—the year after she added the dedicated phonics texts to Units of Study—she published an eight-page document called “No One Gets to Own the Term ‘The Science of Reading,’ ” which referred dismissively to “phonics-centric people” and “the new hype about phonics.” This tone drove her opponents mad: Now that Calkins had been forced to adapt, she wanted to decide what the science of reading was?
		  
		  “Her document is not about the science that I know; it is about Lucy Calkins,” [wrote the cognitive neuroscientist Mark Seidenberg](https://seidenbergreading.net/2019/12/06/lucy-calkins-on-the-attack/), one of the critics interviewed in _Sold a Story_. “The purpose of the document is to protect her brand, her market share, and her standing among her many followers.”
		  
		  Talking with Calkins herself, it was hard to nail down to what extent she felt that the criticisms of her earlier work were justified. When I asked her how she was thinking about phonics in the 2000s, she told me: “Every school has a phonics program. And I would always talk about the phonics programs.” She added that she brought phonics specialists to Columbia’s Teachers College several times a year to help train aspiring educators. (James Cunningham, at UNC Chapel Hill, backed this up, telling me, “She was certainly not wearing a sandwich billboard around: DON’T TEACH PHONICS.”)
		  
		  But still, I asked Calkins, would it be fair to say that phonics wasn’t your bag?
		  
		  “I felt like phonics was something that you have the phonics experts teach.”
		  
		  So where does this characterization of you being hostile toward phonics come from?
		  
		  “Hopefully, you understand I’m not stupid. You would have to be stupid to not teach a 5-year-old phonics.”
		  
		  But some people didn’t, did they? They were heavily into context and cueing.
		  
		  “I’ve never heard of a kindergarten teacher who doesn’t teach phonics,” Calkins replied.
		  
		  Because this is America, the reading debate has become a culture war. When _Sold a Story_ came along in 2022, it resonated with a variety of audiences, including center-left education reformers and parents of children with learning disabilities. But it also galvanized political conservatives. Calkins’s Units of Study was already under attack from the right: In 2021, an article in the Manhattan Institute’s _City Journal_ titled “[Units of Indoctrination](https://www.city-journal.org/article/units-of-indoctrination)” had criticized the curriculum, alleging that the way it teaches students to analyze texts “amounts to little more than radical proselytization through literature.”
		  
		  The podcast was released at an anxious time for American education. During the coronavirus pandemic, many schools—particularly in blue states—were closed for months at a time. Masking in classrooms made it harder for children to lip-read what their teachers were saying. [Test scores fell, and have only recently begun to recover](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/31/us/pandemic-learning-loss-recovery.html).
		  
		  “Parents had, for a period of time, a front-row seat based on Zoom school,” Annie Ward, a recently retired assistant superintendent in Mamaroneck, New York, told me. She wondered if that fueled a desire for a “back to basics” approach. “If I’m a parent, I want to know the teacher is teaching and my kid is sitting there soaking it up, and I don’t want this loosey-goosey” stuff.
		  
		  “The science of reading” has now become a brand name, another off-the-shelf solution to America’s educational problems.
		  
		  Disgruntled parents quickly gathered online. Moms for Liberty, a right-wing group that started out by opposing school closures and mask mandates, began lobbying state legislators to change school curricula as well. The reading wars began to merge with other controversies, such as how hard schools should push diversity-and-inclusion programs. (The Moms for Liberty website recommends _Sold a Story_ on its resources page.) “We’re failing kids everyday, and Moms for Liberty is calling it out,” [a co-founder, Tiffany Justice, told _Education Week_ in October of last year](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/with-moms-for-liberty-endorsement-science-of-reading-faces-more-political-controversy/2023/10). “The idea that there’s more emphasis placed on diversity in the classroom, rather than teaching kids to read, is alarming at best. That’s criminal.”
		  
		  Ward’s district was not “teaching Lucy,” but using its own bespoke balanced-literacy curriculum. In the aftermath of the pandemic, Ward told me, the district had several “contentious” meetings, including one in January 2023 where “we had ringers”—attendees who were not parents or community members, but instead seemed to be activists from outside the district. “None of us in the room recognized these people.” That had never happened before.
		  
		  I had met Ward at a dinner organized by Calkins at her home, which is also the headquarters of Mossflower—the successor to the center that Calkins used to lead at Teachers College. The evening demonstrated that Calkins still has star power. On short notice, she had managed to assemble half a dozen superintendents, assistant superintendents, and principals from New York districts.
		  
		  “Any kind of disruption like this has you think very carefully about what you’re doing,” Edgar McIntosh, an assistant superintendent in Scarsdale, told me. But he, like several others, was frustrated by the debate. During his time as an elementary-school teacher, he had discovered that some children could decode words—the basic skill developed by phonics—but struggled with their meaning. He worried that parents’ clamor for more phonics might come at the expense of teachers’ attention to fluency and comprehension. Raymond Sanchez, the superintendent of Tarrytown’s school district, said principals should be able to explain how they were adding more phonics or decodable texts to existing programs, rather than having “to throw everything out and find a series that has a sticker that says ‘science of reading’ on it.”
		  
		  This, to me, is the key to the anti-Lucy puzzle. Hanford’s reporting was thorough and necessary, but its conclusion—that whole language or balanced literacy would be replaced by a shifting, research-based movement—is hard to reconcile with how American education actually works. The science of reading started as a neutral description of a set of principles, but it has now become a brand name, another off-the-shelf solution to America’s educational problems. The answer to those problems might not be to swap out one commercial curriculum package for another—but that’s what the system is set up to enable.
		  
		  Gail Dahling-Hench, the assistant superintendent in Madison, Connecticut, has experienced this pressure firsthand. Her district’s schools don’t “teach Lucy” but instead follow a bespoke local curriculum that, she says, uses classroom elements associated with balanced literacy, such as the workshop model of students studying together in small groups, while also emphasizing phonics. That didn’t stop them from running afoul of the new science-of-reading laws.
		  
		  In 2021, Connecticut passed a “Right to Read” law mandating that schools choose a K–3 curriculum from an approved list of options that are considered compliant with the science of reading. Afterward, Dahling-Hench’s district was denied a waiver to keep using its own curriculum. (Eighty-five districts and charter schools in Connecticut applied for a waiver, but only 17 were successful.) “I think they got wrapped around the axle of thinking that programs deliver instruction, and not teachers,” she told me.
		  
		  Dahling-Hench said the state gave her no useful explanation for its decision—nor has it outlined the penalties for noncompliance. She has decided to stick with the bespoke curriculum, because she thinks it’s working. According to test scores released a few days after our conversation, her district is among the best-performing in the state.
		  
		  Keeping the current curriculum also avoids the cost of preparing teachers and administrators to use a new one—a transition that would be expensive even for a tiny district like hers, with just five schools. “It can look like $150,000 to $800,000 depending on which program you’re looking at, but that’s a onetime cost,” Dahling-Hench said. Then you need to factor in annual costs, such as new workbooks.
		  
		  You can’t understand this controversy without appreciating the sums involved. Refreshing a curriculum can cost a state millions of dollars. People on both sides will therefore suggest that their opponents are motivated by money—either saving their favored curriculum to keep the profits flowing, or getting rich through selling school boards an entirely new one. Talking with teachers and researchers, I heard widespread frustration with America’s commercial approach to literacy education. Politicians and bureaucrats tend to love the idea of a packaged solution—_Buy this and make all your problems go away!_—but the perfect curriculum does not exist.
		  
		  “If you gave me any curriculum, I could find ways to improve it,” Aukerman, at the University of Calgary, told me. She thinks that when a teaching method falls out of fashion, its champions are often personally vilified, regardless of their good faith or expertise. In the case of Lucy Calkins and balanced literacy, Aukerman said, “If it weren’t her, it would be someone else.”

		  Jeff Brown for _The Atlantic_
		  
		  One obvious question about the science of reading is, well … what is it? The evidence for some kind of explicit phonics instruction is compelling, and states such as Mississippi, which has adopted early screening to identify children who struggle to read—and which holds back third graders if necessary—[appear to be improving their test scores](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/kids-reading-scores-have-soared-in-mississippi-miracle). Beyond that, though, things get messy.
		  
		  Dig into this subject, and you can find frontline teachers and credentialed professors who contest every part of the consensus. And I mean _every_ part: Some academics don’t even think there’s a reading crisis at all.
		  
		  American schools might be ditching Units of Study, but balanced literacy still has its defenders. A 2022 analysis in England, which mandates phonics, found that systematic reviews “do not support a synthetic phonics orientation to the teaching of reading; they suggest that a balanced-instruction approach is most likely to be successful.”
		  
		  The data on the effects of specific methods can be conflicting and confusing, which is not unusual for education studies, or psychological research more generally. I feel sorry for any well-intentioned superintendent or state legislator trying to make sense of it all. One of the classrooms at Oceanside School 8 had a wall display devoted to “growth mindset,” a fashionable intervention that encourages children to believe that instead of their intelligence and ability being fixed, they can learn and evolve. Hoping to improve test scores, many schools have spent thousands of dollars each implementing “growth mindset” lessons, which proponents once argued should be a “national education priority.” (Some proponents also hoped, earnestly, that the approach could help bring peace to the Middle East.) But in the two decades since growth mindset first became ubiquitous, the lofty claims made about its promise have come down to earth.
		  
		  Keeping up with all of this is more than any teacher—more than any school board, even—can reasonably be expected to do. After I got in touch with her, Emily Hanford sent me seven emails with links to studies and background reading; I left Calkins’s house loaded down with units of her curricula for younger students. More followed in the mail.
		  
		  Even the most modest pronouncements about what’s happening in American schools are difficult to verify, because of the sheer number of districts, teachers, and pupils involved. In _Sold a Story_, Hanford suggested that some schools were succeeding with Units of Study only because parents hired personal tutors for their children. But corroborating this with data is impossible. “I haven’t figured out a way to quantify it, except in a very strong anecdotal way,” Hanford told me.
		  
		  Some teachers love “teaching Lucy,” and others hate it. Is one group delusional? And if so, which one? Jenna and Christina, who have both taught kindergarten in New York using Units of Study, told me that the curriculum was too invested in the idea of children as “readers” and “writers” without giving them the basic skills needed to read and write. (They asked to be identified only by their first names in case of professional reprisals.) “It’s a piece of shit,” Christina said. She added: “We’re expecting them to apply skills that we haven’t taught them and that they aren’t coming to school with. I’ve been trying to express that there’s a problem and I get called negative.” Jenna had resorted to a covert strategy, secretly teaching phonics for up to 90 minutes a day instead of the brief lessons she was instructed to provide.
		  
		  But for every Jenna or Christina, there’s a Latasha Holt. After a decade as a third- and fourth-grade teacher in Arkansas, Holt is now an associate professor of elementary literacy at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where she has watched from the sidelines as the tide turned against Calkins. “The dismantling of this thing, it got to me, because I had taught under Units of Study,” she told me. “I’ve used it, and I knew how good it was. I had lived it; I’ve seen it work; I knew it was good for kids.”
		  
		  Calkins still has a “ferocious” drive, she told me, and a deep conviction in her methods, even as they evolve.
		  
		  Aubrey Kinat is a third-grade teacher in Texas who recently left her position at a public school because it decided to drop Units of Study. (The school now uses another curriculum, which was deemed to align better with the science of reading.) Suddenly, she was pushed away from full novels and toward approved excerpts, and her lessons became much more heavily scripted. “I felt like I was talking so much,” she told me. “It took the joy out of it.”
		  
		  For many school boards facing newly politicized parents who came out of the pandemic with strong opinions, ditching Lucy has had the happy side effect of giving adults much more control over what children read. Calkins and some of her dinner guests had suggested that this might be the true reason for the animus around independent reading. “I do start to wonder if this really is about wanting to move everybody towards textbooks,” Calkins said.
		  
		  Eighteen months after her series launched, Hanford returned in April 2024 with two follow-up episodes of _Sold a Story_, which took a less polemical tone. Unsurprisingly so: Calkins had lost, and she had won.
		  
		  The science of reading is the new consensus in education, and its advocates are the new establishment. It is now on the hook for the curriculum changes that it prompted—and for America’s reading performance more generally. That is an uncomfortable position for those who care more about research than about winning political fights.
		  
		  Some of the neuroscience underpinning _Sold a Story_ was provided by Seidenberg, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. (He did not respond to an interview request.) Since the series aired, he has welcomed the move away from Units of Study, but he has also warned that “none of the other major commercial curricula that are currently available were based on the relevant science from the ground up.”
		  
		  Because the usefulness of phonics is one of the few science-of-reading conclusions that is immediately comprehensible to laypeople, “phonics” has come to stand in for the whole philosophy. In a blog post last year, Seidenberg lamented that, on a recent Zoom call, a teacher had asked if they needed to keep teaching phonemic awareness once children were good readers. (The answer is no: Sounding out letters is what you do until the process becomes automatic.) Seidenberg now worried that the science of reading is “at risk of turning into a new pedagogical dogma.”
		  
		  Hanford has also expressed ambivalence about the effects of _Sold a Story_. She compared the situation to the aftermath of No Child Left Behind, a George W. Bush–era federal education initiative that heavily promoted a literacy program called Reading First. “It became focused on products and programs,” Hanford told me, adding that the ethos turned into “get rid of whole language and buy something else.” However, she is glad that the importance of phonics—and the research backing it—is now more widely understood, because she thinks this can break the cycle of revolution and counterrevolution. She added that whenever she talks with lawmakers, she stresses the importance of continuing to listen to teachers.
		  
		  What about her portrait of Calkins as rich, privileged, oblivious? Forget the monogrammed towels, I told Hanford; there is a more benign explanation for Calkins’s worldview: Everywhere she goes, she meets people, like the teachers and children in Oceanside, who are overjoyed to see her, and keen to tell her how much they love Units of Study.
		  
		  But Hanford told me that she’d included the towels line because “the vast majority of teachers, especially elementary-school teachers, in America are white, middle-class women.” Many of these women, she thought, had enjoyed school themselves and didn’t intuitively know what it was like to struggle with learning to read and write.
		  
		  Reporting this story, I was reminded again and again that education is both a mass phenomenon and a deeply personal one. People I spoke with would say things like _Well, he’s never done any classroom research_. _She’s never been a teacher_. _They don’t understand things the way I do_. The education professors would complain that the cognitive scientists didn’t understand the history of the reading wars, while the scientists would complain that the education professors didn’t understand the latest peer-reviewed research. Meanwhile, a teacher must command a class that includes students with dyslexia as well as those who find reading a breeze, and kids whose parents read to them every night alongside children who don’t speak English at home. At the same time, school boards and state legislators, faced with angry parents and a welter of conflicting testimony, must answer a simple question: Should we be “teaching Lucy,” or not?
		  
		  No matter how painful the past few years have been, though, Calkins is determined to keep fighting for her legacy. At 72, she has both the energy to start over again at Mossflower and the pragmatism to have promised her estate to further the cause once she’s gone. She still has a “ferocious” drive, she told me, and a deep conviction in her methods, even as they evolve. She does not want “to pretend it’s a brand-new approach,” she said, “when in fact we’ve just been learning; we’re just incorporating more things that we’ve learned.”
		  
		  But now that balanced literacy is as unfashionable as whole language, Calkins is trying to come up with a new name for her program. She thought she might try “comprehensive literacy”—or maybe “rebalancing literacy.” Whatever it takes for America to once again feel confident about “teaching Lucy.”

	- ## A Giant, High-Quality Screen for Comfortable Reading
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0002-reading-on-bed-with-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- One of the things that I love about the Onyx Boox Go is its relatively large screen, which makes for easier reading. Because it has ample screen real estate, I could easily adjust the font size of my e-books to something comfortable. This is crucial, especially if you’re reading in bed using a dim light.
	- The tablet’s screen is also not just large—it also has a high resolution. The Boox Go 10.3 is equipped with an E Ink Carta Plus (Carta 1200) display that offers a 2480 x 1860 resolution, much higher than the 1920 x 1080 resolution of Full HD displays. This gives it a 300 ppi pixel density for sharpness and clarity.
	- Aside from that, I found that the 10.3-inch display is about the size of the large notebooks I loved using back in school. Some users might feel that it’s a bit too large for one-handed use, but I usually prop it up on my chest for support while in bed. Furthermore, the large display and its paper-like surface make it the perfect digital notebook if you love taking handwritten notes.
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0003-taking-notes-with-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- Another feature that makes the Onyx Boox Go 10.3 such a useful device is the included stylus that makes it feel as if you’re writing on a paper surface. The combination of the Wacom sensor layer, the matte screen, and the stylus makes it feel just like any other paper notebook. So, if you don’t like the feeling of using a stylus on a glass surface, like with the iPad Air and the Apple Pencil, but you still want a way to take digital handwritten notes, then this e-ink tablet is for you.
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0004-drawing-on-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- The Wacom sensor and stylus combination also allows the tablet to recognize up to 4,096 degrees of pressure, which means it can detect how light or heavy your touch is. This is especially pretty useful for sketching, as it will vary how much ink it puts down on the paper based on the minute movements of your hand.
	- The stylus also attaches magnetically to the tablet for convenience, allowing you to always have it within reach. I wouldn’t want to store the stylus there permanently, though, as you could easily knock it off and lose it. Furthermore, the stylus nib is a bit soft, so you might quickly wear it out if you’re heavy-handed like me. Thankfully, the package has a few extra nibs, allowing you to easily replace them.
	- ## Magnetic Case Included (If You Buy From the Onyx Website)
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0005-magnetic-case-for-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- If you purchase the tablet directly from the Onyx website, you’ll get a magnetic hard case included for free. This nice leather-like case secures directly to the Boox Go 10.3 magnetically and includes a magnetic strap that will help keep the case closed when in your bag.
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/0006-magnetic-case-acting-as-stand-for-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- The magnetic strap also has several other functions aside from holding the case closed. You can use it to secure the stylus on the tablet, serving as a sort of stylus case that will prevent it from falling off even if you’re moving about. It can also serve as a stand for the case, allowing you to use it as a drawing tablet propped at a 30-degree angle.
	- ## Amazing Battery Life
	- Of course, one of the biggest advantages of using an e-ink tablet versus an iPad or Android tablet is its battery life. When I use my iPad Air to take notes for a little over an hour, I use up around 30% of the battery with the brightness set to maximum.
	- On the other hand, I’ve been using the Onyx Boox Go 10.3 for over a week now, spending about an hour a day reading and taking notes, and I still have 69% battery life left. At this rate, I could likely go weeks, maybe even a month, between charges. It also charges pretty quickly — you need less than an hour to make it go from empty to full.
	- ## A Large Library of Free Classics
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0007-onyx-boox-go-10-3-library.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- Since the Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is primarily an e-book reader, it's great to see that it comes with a large library of free classics. Right on its home screen, you can see the Store tab which offers a huge number of books from Project Gutenberg. It has some classics like William Shakespeare, Machiavelli’s *The Prince*, and even *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*.
	- However, it lacks a few modern titles, like *V for Vendetta*, *Animal Farm*, and *1984*. I also can’t find titles like *Lord of the Rings*, *Harry Potter*, and the *Chronicles of Narnia*, so I had to resort to the Kindle app to find and buy them.
	- ## Works With Other Apps, Too
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0008-onyx-boox-go-10-3-apps.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- Since the Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is a full Android tablet as well, you can install third-party apps from the Google Play Store. This is what allowed me to make the most of it as an e-book reader since I could install the Kindle app to get access to my library there.
	- But more than that, I could also download and install other apps that make it a more useful tablet. I installed OneNote on it for reading my old notes and other notes that I use with my iPad. However, I prefer using the built-in Notes app to write notes on the Boox Go 10.3, as it offers a superior experience, especially with the included stylus.
	- I also installed Spotify and YouTube Music on it, so I could listen to soft tunes while reading if I wanted to relax. However, I noticed that it drained the e-ink tablet’s battery much more quickly, so I stopped doing that.
	- Since the Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is a full tablet, I installed other apps that are not meant for e-ink tablets, like YouTube and even games like *World of Tanks Blitz*. However, I would not recommend that as the tablet is often not powerful enough to run those apps, and you will just encounter issues with the notoriously slow refresh rate of the e-ink screen.
	- ## The Magic of Bluetooth and Wired Connectivity
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0009-bluetooth-keyboard-paired-to-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- This e-ink tablet has Bluetooth, so you can connect your other devices. For example, I connected my Bluetooth keyboard to the Boox Go 10.3, which allowed me to use it as a distraction-free writing tool. I did try connecting my wireless mouse to the tablet, but I don’t think the cursor interface is well-suited to the low responsiveness of the display.
	- Aside from Bluetooth, you could also connect other devices to the e-ink tablet via its USB-C port. It detected my USB-C hub, allowing me to connect several peripherals, like a wired mouse and keyboard and even USB-C headphones. However, the tablet warned me that doing those things would quickly drain its battery.
	- ## Don’t Trust Its AI Features
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0010-ai-mistake-in-the-onyx-boox-go-10-3.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- The Boox Go 10.3 features a floating main menu, and in it is an AI assistant. I tried asking it about some information on the book that I’m reading, *The Hunt for Red October* (which I’ve already read over four times), and I discovered that it was woefully inaccurate.
	- For example, I asked it about a secondary character in the Tom Clancy Ryanverse—Sir Basil Charleston. The AI said that Charleston was the captain of the Soviet submarine that was pursuing the Red October when, in fact, he is a member of the British Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6. I also asked it about the specifications of the Boox Go 10.3, and it gave the numbers of the previous version of the tablet, not the newest one.
	- ## Should You Buy the Onyx Boox Go 10.3?
	- ![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/10/0011-onyx-boox-go-10-3-with-handwritten-note.jpg){:width 750 :height 500}
	- Jowi Morales / MakeUseOf
	- The [Onyx Boox Go 10.3](https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Tablet-Go-10-3-ePaper/dp/B0D4DFT3W3/?tag=makeusw-20\&ascsubtag=UUmuoUeUpU2033930\&asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.makeuseof.com%2Fonyx-boox-go-10-3-review%2F\&asc_campaign=Authority) is a great device for avid readers and prolific notetakers. So, if you’re one or the other (or both), this is a highly recommended gadget. Even though it has a relatively large display, it’s still light at just 365 grams and is pretty easy to hold. However, you should always remember that this is primarily an e-book reader and note-taker. You'll be disappointed if you expect this to be like a full tablet that responds quickly and can do anything.
	- The Kindle Scribe is a suitable alternative to this e-ink tablet, and it’s cheaper by $40. However, you’re losing out on the slightly larger display and 64GB storage with the Amazon product. And since you can install the Kindle app on the Onyx Boox Go 10.3, you really aren’t missing out on much.
