			- Zone of Interest is in making us aware of how persistently we’re willing to live in a state of convenient denial of mass slaughter, even with full knowledge of our own complicity in it. We’re doing it right now.
			- This isn’t just a film about Nazis. This is a film about us.
			  If you won’t take my word for the intended impact of the film, you might take the director’s. Glazer is saying in every interview, “This is not about the past, it’s about now.”

  **11:18** [[religion]] :  [Richard Rohr - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rohr)
	- The [perennial philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy)[[20]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rohr#cite_note-20) forms the basis of much of Rohr's teaching; his work's essential message focuses on the union of divine reality with all things and the human potential and longing for this union. Rohr and other 21st-century spiritual leaders explore the Perennial Tradition in the Center for Action and Contemplation's issue of the publication *Oneing*.[[21]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rohr#cite_note-Holcomb_2017_p._175-21) In a similar vein, he sometimes draws on [spiral dynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_dynamics) and [Ken Wilber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber)'s [integral theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)). Psychological concepts from [Carl Jung](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung) and the [Enneagram of Personality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality) are also recurring themes in his work.
	- Rohr emphasizes "alternative orthodoxy", a term the Franciscan tradition has applied to itself, referring to a focus on "[orthopraxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthopraxy)"—a belief that lifestyle and practice are much more important than mere verbal orthodoxy,[[15]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rohr#cite_note-15) which he feels is much overlooked in Catholic preaching today.[16](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rohr#cite_note-16)
