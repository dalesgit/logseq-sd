	- Unlike any other president, Donald Trump has tested the words and ideas in the literal text of the US Constitution, from the Preamble through the 27th Amendment. There are multiple passages he has said or suggested he will ignore or reinterpret.
	- The president-elect wants to [end birthright citizenship](https://www.cnn.com/2024/12/22/politics/birthright-citizenship-trumps-plan-end/index.html "end birthright citizenship"), even though it’s in the 14th Amendment. His pledge to [use “impoundment” to save money](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/politics/donald-trump-impoundment-congress-what-matters/index.html "use “impoundment” to save money") runs afoul of the idea that the legislature has the power of the purse. He has mused about [ending the](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/politics/trump-income-taxes-tariffs/index.html "ending the") [federal](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/politics/trump-income-taxes-tariffs/index.html "federal") [income tax](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/politics/trump-income-taxes-tariffs/index.html "income tax"), groused about the [Senate’s role in confirming](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/politics/trump-senate-recess-appointments-gop-leader/index.html "Senate’s role in confirming") appointees and joked about staying in power after his second term ends. But the Constitution is clear in what it does and does not allow.

But he was assailed by high inflation, illegal immigration and the inexorable march of time.
