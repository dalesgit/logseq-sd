		  Wiener’s recognition of the danger posed by the Nazis didn’t begin after Hitler came to power in 1933. Instead, he can justly lay claim to having been one of the first intellectuals to raise the alarm about the rise of antisemitism after World War I.

  Michael Servetus (1511-1553) and the Discovery of Pulmonary Circulation
  CHRISTODOULOS STEFANADIS1, MARIANNA KARAMANOU2, GEORGE ANDROUTSOS2
  11st Cardiology Department, 2Department of History of Medicine, Athens Medical School, Athens, Greece
  Michael Servetus was the first doctor ever to challenge and scientifically argue against the theories of Galen, which predominated for 14 centuries in medical schools worldwide. Even though he was relatively correct in scientific terms, Servetus was punished because of his boldness in challenging Galen’s theories and was con- demned to death by the Holy Inquisition. Yet, by publicly challenging Galen’s and Hippocrates’ predominant and unquestionable lessons on medicine for the first time, Servetus opened the door for other doctors to chal- lenge and correct those theories and subsequently to bring about a new view of human anatomy and physiol- ogy. This article underlines the contribution of Servetus to the description of the pulmonary circulation.
