	- Note on Sd with Cherrie:
	  
	  What happened:  She expressed the part of her that wants to be present to all people and a part that checks out/becomes numb.  We were able to help her separate these two inner sources and help them see each other.  We invited the numb part to share it's feeling (overwhelmed) and the true self part to hear that and to show it compassion, give it words of wisdom.  I asked her to name the true self part (Aria) and describe her so now she has an image she can become more intimate with.  In real SD, I might invite her to spend time with Aria in the month in between sessions as a spiritual practice-  perhaps, give artistic expression to her via poetry, finding a song that captures her essence, etc.  The more comfortable she becomes with Aria, the more the overwhelmed part might begin to trust her, that she has all the resources she needs so that "overwhelmed" might take a break from protecting by checking out.  Overwhelmed was not only checking out but being self-critical about it.  However, she was also able to name how it was helpful in some way- is there a gift checking out is giving? (asking that part to give the whole story) She was also able to identify when it was not- she desires connection.  All important things in spiritual direction- heightened awareness of internal dynamics, what is unhealed and how we can tap into our Divine nature to tend to ourselves with compassion.
