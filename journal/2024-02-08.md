	  The Family Dog, a concert dance hall that was located at 1601 West Evans. The Venue which was only open from September 1967 to July 1968 launched Denver as a major stop off for up and coming groups which eventually became icons. Never before seen groups like the Doors, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Buffalo Springfield, Janis Joplin and Chuck Berry. Some of the groups were already on the music scene but for others it was a springboard. The 2020 documentary Tale of the Dog highlights the early psychedelic, rock and roll and blues scene in the Denver area.
