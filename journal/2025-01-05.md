	- **Pippa Passes** is a [verse drama](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_drama) by [Robert Browning](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Browning). It was published in 1841 as the first volume of his *Bells and Pomegranates* series, in a low-priced two-column edition for [sixpence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixpence_(British_coin)),[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Passes#cite_note-1) and republished in his collected *Poems* of 1849,[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Passes#cite_note-2) where it received much more critical attention. It was dedicated "most admiringly to the author of *[Ion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(Talfourd_play))*"[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pippa_Passes#cite_note-orr-1891-3), that is, [Thomas Noon Talfourd](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Noon_Talfourd). It is best known for the lines "God's in his heaven— / All's right with the world!"
