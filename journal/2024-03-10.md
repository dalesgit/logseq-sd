He is the symbol of the man out of health, happiness, grace. He is cold not merely in his extremities, but cold, as we say, to his marrow, or worse, to his very heart. He is a man, but deprived of what his being should have. Enlighten and warm him by grace, and he is changed all over.

				- MALCOLM MAGEE, O.P.
			- THE Christian sacrament is at once cause and sign. Each sacrament is a cause which signifies the kind of grace it produces and a sign which causes what it signifies. In the sacrament we have a perfect coincidence of sign and instrument, for in performing the signifying action we are also constructing an instrument used by God to confer grace. Now it is obvious that the causing of grace is something much more mysterious and much more important than its signification, and in the face of a Protestant criticism which denied all efficiency to the sacraments and saw them simply as symbols or memorials of Christ's life, it is not surprising that Catholic apologetics should have emphasized this causal character of the sacraments. The Christian sacrament is
			- a genuine cause of grace, operating not only dispositively or 'morally', but *directly* causing what it signifies.
			- And yet such an emphasis can defeat its own purpose if it obscures or attempts to by-pass this other function of the sacrament, for the notion of sacramental causality itself becomes unintelligible unless it is seen as a sign-causality; and it is worth remembering that in the sacramental theology of St Augustine and St Thomas it is this conception of the sacrament as a sign which is dominant. 'Sacrament means sacred sign. A sacrament is a sign of a sacred reality.' It is not until he has devoted two questions of his treatise in the Summa to an examination of

		  > From the very beginning, faith, hope, and love are planted deep within our nature—indeed they are our very nature (Romans 5:5, 8:14–17). The Christian life is simply a matter of becoming who we already are (1 John 3:1–2, 2 Peter 1:3–4). But we have to awaken, allow, and advance this core identity by saying a conscious yes to it and drawing upon it as a reliable and Absolute Source.*9 Again, image must become likeness. And even a good theology will have a hard time making up for a bad anthropology. If the human person is a “pile of manure,” even the “snow of Christ” only covers it and does not undo it. **P.65**
