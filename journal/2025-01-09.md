- [[technical]] Zoom Logseq app: 
  collapsed:: true
	- To zoom in or out on the Logseq app, you can use the standard keyboard shortcuts: ==Ctrl + + to zoom in and Ctrl + - to zoom out on Windows and Linux, or Command + + and Command + - on macOS==.
	- Key points about Logseq zoom:
	- **Universal zoom:** 
	  
	  This keyboard shortcut will zoom the entire Logseq interface, including text, graphs, and sidebars.
	- **Mouse wheel zoom:** 
	  
	  You can also zoom using your mouse wheel while holding down the Ctrl key (or Command on Mac).
	- **No dedicated zoom setting:** 
	  
	  Logseq
	  doesn't have a specific setting to adjust the zoom level directly 
	  within the interface, relying solely on keyboard shortcuts.
	- I adjusted the editor font size in settings css
