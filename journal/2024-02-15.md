	- If you read my regular column, *[The Art of Life](https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxUkEGOhCAQRU8juzZQQlssWMymr2EKKZW0SEchTt9-Ys9mprb18_7LH6nwnPe3m3bm28nrmBOL4HRQaFCwU73srUarUXCiuA4zb7xT4TBQ-fNFNGJx1N27YCVaS_cJtaEgey-hD8EaqRBEdCBBS1AaQBmNbddaMymDxo_aowWL7Zon-93R2WiZZmiP6o9C47MdcxLxGC7Ty8SVvbJY3VLK62i6rwYeDTzO82yncmUbePBWE93yM-9ZvKofxpxS3WJ5D7yRXzn8Ml7Vr3GkEvM2xOA6QKNA7C4sVBYFjZbzVfgROKoPOVHc3Acuyv_l6sH7xVASrtPyJwAA__-S13F1)*, thank you! If this newsletter is your first introduction to my little writing world, then welcome. I’m honored you came. Through these bite-sized occasional mailings I hope we can reflect together just a little about some ways life invites us to show up to ourselves and to one another with courage, openness and intention. To me, it’s all part of what I like to call “SoulCare.” I think it matters to our daily well-being.
