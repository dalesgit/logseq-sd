		- GOP keep doing:
			- Refusing to vote for the bipartisan-negotiated strongest border protection bill in 30 years because former President Donald Trump wants to campaign on the border issue.
			  Denying women their fundamental right to bodily autonomy.
			  Refusing to support common-sense gun reform.
			  Impeaching officials who have done nothing impeachable.
			  Accomplishing nothing significant in an entire congressional session.
			  Doing nothing to solve the climate crisis.
			  Voting against funding infrastructure projects and then trying to take credit for them.
			  Blocking local government from acting to solve local issues.
			  Attacking public schools and fundamental learning.
			  Being reliably hypocritical on social issues.
			  Siding with Vladimir Putin’s interests over our own.
			  And, in general, doing whatever Trump tells you to do.
