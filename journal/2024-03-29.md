		- Liturgical scholar [Leonel Mitchell](https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Holy-Easter-Great-Fifty/dp/1561011347?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=livingchurc0b-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=e1810bcbc1cf7e6474d0f56034cab376&camp=1789&creative=9325) puts it well:
			- The Good Friday liturgy is a solemn commemoration of and participation in the great events of this day, the salvation of the human race through the victory of Christ, who by dying destroyed death, not a funeral for Jesus. The older custom of wearing black vestments, and the Anglican custom in some places of vesting choir and acolyte in black cassocks without surplices on this day, tends to reinforce the funeral theme. This latter custom apparently stems from the recognition that the Three Hours was not a liturgical service, hence the “vestments” were not worn, but only the cassock, the “street dress” of the clergy. The liturgical color of today is Holy Week red, for Christ the King of martyrs, and albs or surplices are appropriately worn.

	- The incident reveals just how badly some major media outlets have lost 
	  their way. Maybe the ratings frenzy and “both-siderism” have warped 
	  management’s news judgment.
	- We can only hope that NBC and other news organizations take away something
	   more than “don’t hire a MAGA mouthpiece” (as important as that is). A 
	  few ideas:
	- Create a mission statement that affirms your goals are telling the truth and 
	  defending democracy, which protects the First Amendment — not fake 
	  balance.
	- Stop pretending four-times-indicted former president Donald Trump and his movement are 
	  presenting alternative “policies” as a normal party would. They are 
	  fighting for an alternate system: authoritarianism.
	- Politicians’ outright lies must be identified, not just labeled as their “response” or “position.”
	- Instead of obsessing over polls, devote extensive coverage to analyzing the Heritage Foundation’s “[Project 2025](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/22/trump-second-term-extremism/?itid=lk_inline_manual_16)” and Trump’s fascist agenda. Feature historians and political scientists during news segments (not only on panels) to put Trump’s views and 
	  statements in context.
	- Don’t excerpt a few words from a Trump rally or speech, dub it an “argument” and ignore his mental short-circuits and [deteriorating intellect](https://www.salon.com/2024/03/25/forensic-psychiatrist-on-physical-signs-of-mental-decline-changes-in-movement-and-gait/).
