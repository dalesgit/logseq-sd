- # Zoom session re. Haiti (Beyond Borders)[[haiti]] [[beyond boarders]] [[world]]
	- Beyond Borders in Port au Prince is now closed because of violence and chaos of the city. Similar to earthquake in 2010.
	- Map
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1711583314032_0.png)
	- 150,000 people displaced in the city and environs
	- unreliability electricity is non-existent in most of the city. Lack of fuel. access to cash an issue. fuel used to maintain cell phone towers.
	- access to medical facilities absent. cholera outbreak.
	- the assassinated prime minister was an autocrat. There is some hope that there may be signs of possibility in US that Haiti needs democratic rule.
	- Impact on work of Beyond Borders
		- most of their work is thriving
			- where the work is in rural areas, remote. therefore not where gangs are particularly strong
			- administration in offices in Port au Prince because the workers can come out of neighborhoods
			- don't have hospital, infrastructure. Mission is building social structures for sustainable change. By nature less vulnerable to e.g. gangs
			- who leads the work? staff of courageous, committed, well-connected folks.
	- Smith Maxime director in Haiti.
	- Lot of Beyond Borders on the largest island.
		- survivors organized in different parts of the nation. The organization continues.
	- Emmanuela Douyon: why facing this crisis now?
		- complex. result of so many factors. complicated history. colonial exploitation.
		- had to pay restitution $ to the former colonizers
		- later occupied, political influence
		- half of population live in poverty.
		- wealthy are less than 1%
		- corruption is rampant
		- lack of social cohesion
	- US promoted a model that didn't support Haiti producing its own food. Agribusiness lobbying e.g. under Clinton. (discourage local rice production so that Arkansas growers got a market.)
		- women working in factories of that era encouraged free child labor
		- many of the gang members now were once exploited child laborers
		- US policy complicit with the problems.
			- Narco trafficing
			- arms that are produced in US. heavy weapons are now part of the environment.
	- local people need to show respect for gangs in order to survive
	- Next month "We are family" at BB home page. Register for an event in April 17 (fund raising event) whether giving $ or not we will be uplifted.
