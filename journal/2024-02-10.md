- a prayer for our time
	- Do not pray for easy lives. Pray to be stronger. Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers. Pray for powers equal to your tasks. Then the doing of your work will be no miracle, but you yourself, shall be a miracle. Every day you shall wonder at yourself and the richness of your life which has come through the Grace of God.
	- (The Rt. Rev. Phillips Brooks, Bishop of Massachusetts, 1891-1893)/
