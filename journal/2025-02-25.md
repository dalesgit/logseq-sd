Emailed prayer from Linda Feb. 23:

Hi all,

Happy Sunday.  I came across this poem yesterday at a retreat called "Patience Visited Me."  The basic premise was "Patience visited me and reminded me that...Hope visited me and reminded me that...Confidence visited me and reminded me that..."  I thought of it as a beautiful invitation to help people claim the true self when they are overwhelmed by parts, in lieu of having a direct "conversation" between the parts.

1. First, after listening to the directee unburden, we ask what is their desire?
2.  Whatever they say, reframe it as if that quality is visiting (after all, they brought it into the space) -- and ask what it is here to remind them of?
3.  Another way to strengthen our own grounding is to create our own poem using the 8 C's.  "Clarity visited me and reminded me to get plenty of sleep so that yesterday's worries can be laid to rest and brought back to life with the kiss of proper perspective today."  (that is my reminder :)

Lastly, this Thursday you will be in the gracious and loving hands of Mayra Hall, a gifted and seasoned spiritual director who will lead you in the conversation of Ch 4 of In Touch as well as facilitate peer review of Dale's verbatim.  Paul is having his port put in Thursday and so I can only be present the first 30 min or so. You will enjoy her.

Have a great rest of the day!
Peace,
Linda
