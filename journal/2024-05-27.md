- Effort at manipulating music files. #music
	- Android music notation app. Pretty powerful but awkward to get used to and requires $ to export and be useful
	- Musescore is available for my HP. I can import an xml file and got, e.g., a facsimile of American trilogy
		- I have the pdf of it. I paid 5$ to get a scanner file in Android that scans camera or pdf files
		- It got me the xml file used in above.
	- a python app converts xml to abc. I had to use python3 -- but it worked fine on the above file.
