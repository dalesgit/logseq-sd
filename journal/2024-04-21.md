		- ## The divine map
			- Lyn: living in **tension**. Music requires there to be tension in the string.
			- Church needs both crucifixes and resurrected representations if we proclaim both **suffering *and* resurrection** -- (it's not either/or) (MP comments.)
			- > Francis was fully at home in this created world. He saw all things in the visible world as endless dynamic and operative symbols of the Real, a theater and training ground for a heaven p. 111
			- Image of Francis statue, looking down at the ground and seeing the Holy Spirit (dove) -- from Contemplation and Action web site.

		- Always and only the incarnation
			- The need to have **both** suffering and resurrection
			- > This tendency was generically called “Gnosticism,” and I sometimes wonder if the church condemned it so much because we unconsciously knew how heady and Gnostic we ourselves were. “Condemn it over there instead of own it over here” is the operative and common policy of institutions of power. But as the poet and wisdom figure Wendell Berry loves to tell us, “what we need is here.”*2 (p. 114)
		- Permission to go "in" and "down"
			- > In his book *Unmasking the Powers*, theologian and biblical scholar Walter Wink makes a very convincing case that this intuition about the inherent sacredness of creation is precisely what sacred texts are pointing toward when they speak of “angels.”*4 p. 116
		- Respect, Wonder, Reverence
