			- 14 min
		- 3:20 rise 1

		- 2:35 rise 2
			- 2:15 begin gentle knead
			- 15 min
		- before 2:00 rise 3

	- [[Feb 14th, 2024]] I did same recipe as last time on Basic cycle. It still pushed up against the top, just not as quickly and it didn't collapse on itself.
	- Next time try to use flour 3/2 rather than 1 1/2 to 1 1/2
